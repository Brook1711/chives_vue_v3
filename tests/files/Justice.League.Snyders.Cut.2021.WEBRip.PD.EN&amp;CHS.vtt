他们无法保护十万个世界

149
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.810

154
00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.000
我们无畏无惧
We have no fear!

155
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.890
召集军团
Gather the legions!

156
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.980
跟她去

157
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.270
你必须封住山洞
You must seal the cage!

158

162
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.960
让我们光荣战死  这是对的
Honor us. It's right.

163
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.250
封住大门
Seal it.

164
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.130
拿起大槌
Ready the hammers!

165
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.150
快封住它
Seal it now!

166
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.540
用生命守护它
Guard it with your life.

167
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.500
-遵命  我的女王  -让它保持移动

169
00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.190
高贵的女王  你为何抗拒

170
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.990
你救不了她
You can't save her.

171
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.610
你救不了任何人
You can't save any of them.

172
00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.540
伟大的黑暗即将降临
The great darkness begins.

173
00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:41.670
亚马逊女战士
Amazons!

174
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.930
是的  我们会找到其他的

175
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.140
拉弓
-Draw!

176
00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.980
放箭
Loose!

177

他去了人类的世界

寻找另外两个母盒

181
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.590
我们必须点燃古老的警示烽火

182
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.930
烽火五千年未曾燃烧
The fire has not burned for 5,000 years.

183
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.640
人类不会知道它的意义
Men won't know what it means.

184
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:22.850
人类不会知道
Men won't.

185
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.020
她会知道
She will.

186
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.960
第二章

187
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.960
英雄时代

188
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.390
这里是有毒的
It's toxic.

189
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.260
很好
That's good.

190
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.410
去吧
Go!

191
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.580
跟着母盒的气味
Follow the scent of the Mother Boxes.

192
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:27.290
找到另外两个
Find the missing two.

193
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.340
一旦找到它们  就能形成三位一体
Once they are found, The Unity will be formed.

194
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.250
这个世界将加入其他世界
This world will join the others.

195
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.180
他会很高兴
He will be pleased.

196
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.260
再次看到我的价值
He will see my worth again.

197
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.440
有酒类专卖店那小鬼的消息吗
Anything on that kid from the liquor store?

198
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.020
可能有
Possibly.

199
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:51.980
"可能有"
"Possibly."

200
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.730
每听一次这句话
If I had a dollar for every "possibly."

201
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.530
就会让我更受不了你
Yeah, it would make you even more insufferable.

202
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:04.200
脸部辨识可能找到匹配
Facial scan might have got a hit on him,

203
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.200
搞消失的那小子
our disappearing man.

204
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:11.540
中城的巴里·艾伦先生
One Mr. Barry Allen from Central City.

205
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:14.630
也许又是误判  你得给我多点时间
Might be another false positive, you'll have to give me a little time

206
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.010
-才能确认  -我们没有时间了
-to confirm.  -We don't have any more time.

207
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.470
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne,

208
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:24.140
你一直在拼命地创建这个团队
you've been working as if there's no tomorrow to build this team

209
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.140
但却找不到任何队友
of people you can't even find.

210
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.430
我找到一个  是两个  包括戴安娜
I found one. I found two, including Diana.

211
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.560
就因为莱克斯·卢瑟说  地球会受到攻击
Just because Lex Luthor says the planet's in danger of attack?

212
00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.730
这跟莱克斯·卢瑟无关
This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor.

213
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.110
这跟他有关
It has to do with him.

214
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.700
我在他的坟上向他承诺
I made a promise to him on his grave.

215
00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.700
我花了很多时间试图造成分裂
I spent a lot of time trying to divide us.

216
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.660
现在必须团结一心才能拯救地球
I need to bring us together and make this right.

217
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.040
卢瑟的警告已经过了一段时间
Well, it's been some time since Luthor's warning.

218
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.420
没有攻击  没有野蛮人冲进大门
No attacks. No barbarians at the gate.

219
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.300
也许这些野蛮人不走大门
Maybe these barbarians don't use a gate.

220
00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:59.840
也许他们已经来了
Maybe they're already here.

221
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.600
继续找  还有什么线索
Keep looking. What else do you have?

222

225
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.640
是啊  我提早下班

226

替我向你家人问好
Tell your family I said hello.

227
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.390
搞什么…
What the...

228
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.480

阿提密斯之箭
The Arrow of Artemis.

230
00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.180
它将射到人类世界
It will reach the lands of men.

231

234
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.120
如昔日一般熊熊燃烧
Burn as you burned in days before.

235
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.160
让她看到历史曙光出现之前的黑暗
Show her the darkness before the daylight of history.

236
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.250
警告我女儿战争已经来临
Warn my daughter that war has come

237
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.340
并且保护她
and protect her.

238
00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:51.360
回到我身边  戴安娜
Return to me, Diana.

239
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.610
你这周末做什么了  戴安娜
What did you do this weekend, Diana?

240
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.280
没做什么特别的
Nothing very interesting.

241
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.370
你每次都这么说
That's all you ever tell us.

242
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.500
没办法  我的生活很无趣
What can I do? I'm not that exciting.

243
00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.130
你一走出去就好像消失一样
You might as well disappear when you walk out of here.

244
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.010
又来了
Again?

245
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.050
-什么事  -又怎么了
-What is it?  -Now what?

246
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.550
预算缩减  盗墓者
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

247
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.220
现在又加了一条"纵火者"

248
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.730
记者在克里特岛连线报导

249
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:08.440
我身后的大篝火熊熊燃烧
As you can see behind me, an enormous bonfire is burning.

250

大火燃烧了一整晚

251

We're now into the morning and we are at least five miles away.

252
00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:18.200
但还是能看到它在燃烧
And we can still see it burning as we speak.

253
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.410
当地居民和政府当局都感到诧异
This has baffled locals and government authorities alike

254
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:26.080
这座历史遗迹亚马逊神殿居然起火
here at this historical site of the so-called shrine of the Amazons.

255
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.750

-他们偷走了一切  -那个呢
They took whatever was in here. That?

我也不知道
I don't know.

You don't know?

270
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:10.040
没错  所以我才在研究它
I don't know, which was why I was studying it.

271

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.940
知道那会是谁或是什么东西吗
Any idea who or what that might be?

288
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.130
母盒在这里不安全
The box isn't safe here.

289
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.090
维克多
Victor,

290
00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.550
他们闯进实验室找它
they came looking for it at the lab.

291
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.140
有些人被某种怪物抓走
People were taken by some kind of monster or something.

292
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.850
你对怪物很了解…
You know a lot about monsters,

293
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.890
对吧
don't you?

294
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:57.400
尤其是怎么制造它们
Especially how to make 'em.

295
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.630
求救…求救…
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

296
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.510
船身受损  我快沉下去了
My hull is breached. I'm going down.

297
00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:13.810
求救
Mayday!

298
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:16.060
有人吗
Is there anybody out there?

299
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.730
威士忌
Whiskey.

300
00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.400
下次叫他要敬畏暴风雨
Tell him to respect the storm next time.

301
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:19.580
他请客
It's on him.

302
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.900
本应是国王的男人
King who would be man.

303
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.230
人类父亲和海洋女王的儿子
Son of a human father and Queen of the Seas.

304
00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:55.860
我浪费了多少时间
All the time I've wasted

305
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:59.070
试图遵守我向你母亲做的承诺
trying to keep the promise I made to your mother.

306
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.410
说完了吗  老头
Are you finished, old man?

307
00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:05.040
虽然你居无定所
You never sleep in the same place twice,

308
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.960
但还是一直回来这里
yet you keep coming back here.

309
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.880
我喜欢这里  很安静
I like it. It's quiet.

310
00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.840
这是你继承的王国
It's your inheritance.

311
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.130
你应当是亚特兰蒂斯国王
You're the rightful king of Atlantis.

312
00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.380
我们的同胞受苦受难
Our people suffer.

313
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:20.510
你的同胞
Your people.

314
00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.220
一个卑鄙残忍  迷信无知的种族
A brutal, petty, superstitious race.

315
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.600
地表有什么不同吗
Is the surface any different?

316
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.730
没人说我是地表之王
Nobody calls me King of the Surface.

317
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.520
你想要什么  维科
What do you want, Vulko?

318
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:34.980
要塞附近的守卫不断消失不见
Guards near the stronghold have been disappearing.

319
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:36.570
来自天上的掠夺者
Snatchers from above.

320
00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:37.950
去跟欧姆国王说啊
Talk to King Orm.

321
00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:39.530
-你弟弟  -表弟
-Your brother?  -Half-brother.

322
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.700
他想煽动和陆地人类的战争
He's trying to fan the flames of war with the surface.

323
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.490
他说谎
He lies.

324
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:49.960
掠夺者来自黑暗之境  他们在寻找它
The snatchers have come from the dark place. They're looking for it.

325
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:54.130
我们守护的母盒并不安全
The Mother Box our people guard is not safe.

326
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:59.130
前往亚特兰蒂斯要塞  保护母盒
Go to the stronghold of Atlantis. Protect the box.

327
00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:01.340
时候到了
The time has come.

328
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.470
把你母亲的三叉戟拿去
Take up your mother's trident.

329
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:20.320
你不能永远弃世界而不顾  亚瑟
You can't turn your back on the world forever, Arthur.

330
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.330
不管是地表或海底
Above or below.

331
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.020
狄萨德
DeSaad.

332
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:59.150
狄萨德  我呼叫你
DeSaad! I call to thee.

333
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:12.370
荒原狼  你开始征服这世界了吗
Steppenwolf, have you begun the conquest?

334
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.880
这个世界是分裂的
This world is divided.

335
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:18.170
他们是原始物种
They are a primitive species.

336
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.670
未进化并与彼此战争
Unevolved and at war with one another.

337
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.680
歧见太深无法团结一心
Too separate to be one.

338
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.100
必须像其他的世界一样  剥夺他们的自由意志
Their free will must be ripped from them, like the other worlds.

339
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:32.390
并以服膺他的光荣信念…
Given absolution in one glorious belief,

340
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.270
获得赦免
to serve him.

341
00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.980
母盒呢
The Mother Boxes?

342
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.480
我找到其中一个
I have found one of the three.

343
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.110
苏醒后呼唤我的那一个
The one that woke and called to me.

344
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.780
另外两个仍然沉睡
The other two still sleep,

345
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:48.780
但天启魔感应到它们
but the parademons feel their presence.

346
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:50.410
它们飞来飞去
They fly,

347
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:54.160
到处搜索  并抓走带有母盒气味的囚犯
they search, they take prisoners who carry the scent,

348
00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:59.250
我则以他之名创建一座要塞
while I build a stronghold in the name of his glory.

349
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.670
很好
Yes.

350
00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.430
强大的荒原狼
Mighty Steppenwolf,

351
00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:11.310
你本来可以与伟大的他平起平坐
who might have sat here by the side of the great one.

352
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:17.810
但却因自大而被放逐
But undone by his self-pride.

353
00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.360
狄萨德
DeSaad...

354
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.820
我跪倒在你面前
I fall before you.

355
00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.360
让我向他求情
Let me make a plea to him

356
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.450
当我以他之名夺下这世界
that I may come home

357
00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:31.410
能否请他让我回家
after I take this world in his name.

358
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.000
你背叛了他
You betrayed him.

359
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.920
你自己的家人
Your own family.

360
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.290
我看到我犯的错误
I saw my mistake.

361
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.050
我屠杀企图争夺他王位的人
I slaughtered those who sought his throne.

362
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:47.340
你还欠他五万个世界
You still owe the great one 50,000 more worlds.

363
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.260
当你还清了债
He will hear your plea

364
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.970
他就会聆听你的恳求
when you pay your debt.

365
00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:58.940
母盒将被寻获并合而为一
The Mother Boxes will be found and united.

366
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.020
这里没有保护者
No protectors here.

367
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:05.610
没有绿光战警  没有氪星人
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

368
00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:09.410
这世界将会像其他的一样沦陷
This world will fall, like all the others.

369
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:12.200
为了达克赛德
For Darkseid.

370
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.620
为了达克赛德
For Darkseid.

371
00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:42.480
我花了几百万元安装保全系统
You know, I paid millions of dollars for this building's security.

372
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.940
钱花得很值得
You got your money's worth.

373
00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.820
我几乎花了一分钟才解除
Took me almost a minute to disable it.

374
00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.700
你好
Hi there.

375
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:52.370
新玩具
A new toy?

376
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.450
原型军队运输机
Prototype troop carrier.

377
00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:00.790
我曾相识的一个人会很想开开看
I once knew a man who would have loved to fly it.

378
01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.380
韦恩航天最顶尖的人才  都无法让它飞起来
The best minds at Wayne Aerospace couldn't make it fly.

379
01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.050
但是你能
But you can?

380
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:08.880
我别无选择
I have no choice.

381
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:11.800
我需要更远的航程和更大的货舱
I need more range and I need more cargo.

382
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:13.550
我认为一场攻击即将来袭
I think there's an attack coming.

383
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:15.720
你错了  布鲁斯
Not coming, Bruce.

384
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.480
它已经来袭了
It's already here.

385
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:23.810
据我所知  他们来自另一个宇宙
From what I've learned, they are things from another universe.

386
01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.320
为一个黑暗力量效忠
They serve a dark power.

387
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.190
一个古老的力量
An old power.

388
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.780
他们想要什么
What do they want?

389
01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:32.950
入侵地球  征服世界
To invade. To conquer.

390
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:38.330
他们很久以前曾经来过
They came here once before, long ago.

391
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.880
一支庞大的舰队出现在天空
A great armada appeared in the sky,

392
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.670
消灭所有胆敢反抗的势力
laying waste to all who opposed it.

393
01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.930
入侵者的首领是达克赛德
The leader of the invaders was a being called Darkseid.

394
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:57.350
这名字在每个宇宙都受到诅咒和畏惧
A name cursed and feared in every universe.

395
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.060
地球的守护者  和达克赛德展开一场大战
Darkseid was met in battle by Earth's defenders.

396
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:04.730
旧神族  人类
The old gods, men...

397
01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:08.440
被迫迁至海底之前的亚特兰蒂斯族
Atlanteans before their descent into the sea...

398
01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.740
遭背叛及被困禁之前的亚马逊族
Amazons before their betrayal and enslavement

399
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:17.280
以及来自星空的守护者
and guardians from the stars.

400
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:21.040
他们的历史教导他们  不能相信彼此
Their histories had taught them not to trust each other,

401
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.370
不能奢望创建联盟
not to hope for an alliance.

402
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.540
而是各自奋战
To fight apart.

403
01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:17.300
当达克赛德在地球发动战争
As Darkseid waged war on Earth,

404
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.890
他发现一个秘密
he found a secret there.

405
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:22.810
隐藏在无垠太空的一股力量
A power hidden in the infinity of space.

406
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.480
他召唤暗黑秘士
He called forth mystics

407
01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.770
他们崇拜并控制三个物体
who worshipped and controlled three objects...

408
01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:28.980
母盒
the Mother Boxes.

409
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.730
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

410
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:31.900
"母盒"
"Mother Boxes"?

411
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.610
坚不可摧  活生生的机器
Indestructible living machines,

412
01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.240
使用先进无比的科技打造  看起来简直就像巫术
made from a science so advanced, it looks like sorcery.

413
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:43.040
若要征服世界  三个母盒必须同步化
To conquer, three boxes have to synchronize

414
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.460
合而为一后形成三位一体
and join together into The Unity.

415
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.670
三位一体以烈火净化星球
The Unity cleanses a planet with fire,

416
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.420
将它转换成另一个敌人世界
transforming it into a copy of the enemy's world.

417
01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:57.090
幸存者都成为达克赛德的仆役
All who live become servants of Darkseid.

418
01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.180
活着  但毫无生机
Alive but drained of life.

419
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:01.720
天启魔
Parademons.

420
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:05.020
亚马逊女战士
-Amazons!

421
01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.610
冲啊
With me!

422
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:44.430
但在三位一体同步化之前
But before The Unity could synchronize,

423
01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.980
地球的守护者组成统一阵线展开反击
the defenders of Earth attacked and fought as one.

424
01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.560
亚马逊人和亚特兰蒂斯人并肩作战
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.

425
01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:56.240
宙斯及他儿子阿瑞斯  和来自星空的守护者联手出击
Zeus and his son Ares alongside the guardians from the sky.

426
01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.910
一群黄金时代英雄为了捍卫地球  同心协力捍卫了地球的生命
A golden Age of Heroes fighting together to defend life on Earth.

427
01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:01.360
他们做到其他世界做不到的事
They did what no world had ever done.

428
01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:03.700
将敌人送回星空
Sent the enemies back into the stars.

429
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.490
三个母盒从未合而为一
The three Mother Boxes never synchronized.

430
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.250
也从未形成三位一体
-The Unity never came to pass.

431
01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:15.620
但在敌人撤退之时
But, in their retreat,

432
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:19.380
母盒被留在地球
the boxes were left behind on Earth.

433
01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:23.260
它们的力量变弱  就像失去主人的恶犬
They grew weak. Dogs without masters

434
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:26.680
开始沉睡
falling asleep,

435
01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.310
等待他们的回归
awaiting their return.

436
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.810
母盒从敌人的视野中消失
Fading from the view of the enemy,

437
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:35.140
隐匿在一兆个世界之中
anonymous among a trillion worlds.

438
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.210
地球的守护者立下誓言
The defenders of Earth made a vow.

439
01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.830
人类  亚特兰蒂斯族及亚马逊族
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.

440
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.880
根据他们文化的惯例及仪式
Each would enshrine and guard one of the three sleeping Mother Boxes

441
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:06.550
各自封存并守卫  其中一个沉睡的母盒
according to the rites and rituals of their culture

442
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.180
以防母盒日后再次苏醒  向天启星发出信号
in case a box should ever wake again to call out to the planet Apokolips

443
01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:13.100
呼唤敌人回来并企图征服
to return and conquer

444
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:17.060
达克赛德唯一落败而逃的世界
the only world Darkseid had ever lost.

445
01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:35.680
有什么唤醒了我的族人守卫的母盒
Something woke the box my people guard.

446
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.430
它向暗黑之处呼唤
It called out to the dark place...

447
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.020
引来达克赛德手下的一名征服者
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.

448
01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.810
敌人已经来袭
The enemy is here.

449
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.980
如果是真的  他在哪里
If he's here, where is he?

450
01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:48.240
他会到处寻找另外两个母盒
He'll be searching for the other two boxes.

451
01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.360
得到三个母盒并准备好之前  他仍在藏匿
Hiding until he has all three. Until he's ready.

452
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:55.370
我们必须准备迎敌  你  我和其他人
Then we have to be ready. You, me, the others.

453
01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.950
他们说英雄时代不会再来临
They said the Age of Heroes would never come again.

454
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.370
会来的
No, it will.

455
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:02.420
必须的
It has to.

456
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:07.670
其他人  他们在哪里
The others. Where are they?

457
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:18.020
第三章

458
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.020
挚爱的母亲，挚爱的儿子

459
01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:21.600

前方减速

462
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:32.360
我迟到了吗  我大迟到了
Am I late? No, I'm so late. I'm very late.

463
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.530

464
01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.820
你好啊  小家伙
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

465
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.490
不行
-Oh. No.

466
01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.160
好吧  晚点见
Okay, bye. Okay.

467
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.960
真是拍谢
-I'm so sorry.

468
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:43.620
我迟到了
I'm late.

469
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:50.170
-你是…  -我…
-Are you, uh...  -I'm...

470
01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.590
抱歉我大迟到了  不是故意的
I'm so sorry I'm so late. I didn't mean to be so late.

471
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.260
我是我  我来了  很抱歉迟到了
I'm me and I'm here and I'm so sorry I'm late.

472
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:56.600
因为公车没来  后来来了
Essentially, the bus didn't come, then the bus did come,

473
01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.060
不过有个阿婆一直在找硬币
but then there was this old woman counting change for the fare,

474
01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.350
五分  一分  五分  一分
like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny.

475
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.270
真是够了  让阿婆上车吧
Like, jeez Louise, let this woman on the bus.

476
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:03.440
她都107岁了
She's 107 years old,

477
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.270
不会再活多久了

拜托
Come on.

482
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:18.410
那是法文来着
From the French, of course.

483
01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:21.620
"履历"是过去分词…
"Resume," I believe, is a past participle of...

484
01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:28.540
这可不妙
Uh, wow. That's no good.

485
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.210
我的口袋有什么  "有只吃纸的怪物"
It's like, what lives in my pocket, right? "Paper monster hungry." Uh...

瞧  照顾狗狗遇到事情  我一定会随身携带肉类零食
See, in times of crisis, for dog work, I always bring a meat snack.

492
01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:54.420
能让狗狗安静下来

493
01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.460
你永远不知道会发生什么事

你一定靠近过母盒

497
01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.260
身上有它的气味
The scent is on you.

498
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.090
它在哪里
Where is it?

499
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:50.390
亚特兰蒂斯族的儿女绝不会告诉你
No son or daughter of Atlantis will ever tell you.

500
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:08.820
我们的族人看守了母盒数千年
Our people have guarded the Mother Box for thousands of years.

501
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.630
我不会背叛自己的族人

502
01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.680
你已经背叛了

503
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:34.240
这是在地球最深的海沟拍到的

507
01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:42.000
那他就是混血儿
Mixed-blood, then.

508
01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:44.040
他说他会和我们一起作战

509
01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:45.550
或多或少吧
More or less.

510
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.010

01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:41.760
我绝不容许
I won't allow it.

565
01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.220
维克多
Victor.

566
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.350
维克多  你不必窝在这里
Victor, you're not stuck in here.

567
01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:53.940
你还有大好的人生
You still have a life ahead of you.

568
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.980
你妈会希望你拥有那样的人生
Your mother would have wanted you to live that life.

569
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:02.070
如果你当时在的话…
If you were there,

570
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:05.320
妈就还会活着
Mom would still be alive.

571
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.080
好吧  听着
All right, look,

572
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.500
你不必给我第二次机会  但是要给自己再一次机会
you don't have to give me a second chance, but give yourself one.

573
01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:20.590
如果你不想看着我
If you can't stand looking at me,

574
01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:23.930
那就试着听我说
try listening.

575
01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.670
你现在的能力  维克多
What you can do now, Victor.

576
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.040
超强力量只是冰山一角
Your physical strength is just the tip of the iceberg.

577
01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:01.760
你拥有无穷潜力
The tip of the tip.

578
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:36.710
在一和零的数位世界  你是绝对的霸主
In the world of ones and zeroes, you are the absolute master.

579
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:39.460
没有防火墙能阻止你
No firewall can stop you.

580
01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.920
没有你破解不了的密码
No encryption can defy you.

581
01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:44.840
一切都任你摆布
We're all at your mercy, Vic.

582
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:47.380
从电厂电网到电信设备
From our power grids to our telecommunications,

583
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:49.600
每个人的生活都受到
everyone's lives are controlled

584
01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.720
复杂的数位网络操控支配
and dominated by complex digital networks

585
01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:56.980
你却能轻而易举掌控它
that will bend without effort to your will.

586
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.830
全世界的命运掌握在你手中
The fate of the world will literally rest in your hands.

587
01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:24.670
你只要动个念头  就能发射所有的核弹
Its entire nuclear arsenal, you could launch with a thought.

588
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:38.640
全球复杂的金融体系
The world's monetary systems and its complex interactions

589
01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:43.270
对你来说就像玩具一样能轻易玩弄
will seem as easy to manipulate for you as a child's plaything.

590
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:21.060
问题是…不  挑战是…
The question... No, the challenge

591
01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.400
不去这么做
won't be doing it.

592
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:27.150
不去滥用这能力
It will be not doing.

593
01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.320
不去监视每个人
Not seeing.

594
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.660
这个重责大任的沉重负担
It is the burden of this responsibility

595
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.120
将塑造你成为什么样的人
that will define you and who you choose to be.

596
01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:09.820
许个愿
Now, make a wish.

597
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:12.110
再吹一次
One more time.

598
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:15.450
很好  像外婆挥手问好
Good job. Wave to Grandma!

599
01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.780
你好  外婆
Hi, Grandma!

600
01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.510
余额不足

601
01:27:12.670 --> 01:27:16.430
恭喜
您赢得十万美元奖金

602
01:27:17.010 --> 01:27:18.180
什么
What?

603
01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:21.810
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

604
01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.440
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

605
01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.350
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

606
01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:33.070
维克多
Victor...

607
01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:38.070
这是我身为一名科学家  做出来的推断
Victor, these are the words and deductions of a scientist.

608
01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.410
也是我一直以来跟你说话的方式
That's how I've been speaking to you.

609
01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.120
现在…
Now,

610
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:49.170
让我说出内心话  不是身为一个科学家
let me speak to you from my heart, not as a scientist,

611
01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.920
而是身为一个父亲
as a father.

612
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.390
喂
Hey.

613
01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:09.190
喂  你
Hey, you!

614
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.000
因为你没有发挥潜力
Because you are

615
01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:31.710
一直在原地打转
holding yourself back.

616
01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:34.050
你打三份没出路的工
You're going in circles, man. Holding down three dead-end jobs,

617
01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:36.840
还要打第四份工  你哪来的时间
going on four. Where do you even find the time?

618
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:38.130
我会挪出时间
I make the time.

619
01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:39.430
-只要再打一份工  -巴里
-I just need one more gig...  -Barry.

620
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:41.220
-就能自己付学费  -你不能
...then I'm gonna pay for my own tuition. You can't.

621
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:44.100
-我说到做到  -别再折磨自己了
Like I always said I would. You cannot keep doing this to yourself.

622
01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:45.930
我不想再谈这件事
Okay. I really don't wanna talk about this again.

623
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.180
拜托  我们有十分钟
-Please, we have 10 minutes.

624
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:48.270
这全是为了付…
-And this is all to pay

625
01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.230
-刑事司法系的学费  -对啊
for a criminal justice degree, huh? Yeah.

626
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.400
为了什么
For what?

627
01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.780
那还用问  我正在跟我爸讲话
Huh, let's see. As I talk to my father,

628
01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.740
他因为杀死我妈坐牢  其实是被冤枉的
who's still in prison for the murder of my mother, which he didn't commit.

629
01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.860
我怎么会对刑事司法感兴趣
Yeah, how did I get interested in criminal justice?

630
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:01.570
我不记得了
I can't remember.

631
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:02.660
真是的
Oh, boy.

632
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:05.370
我注定要选择走这条路  爸
This path has clearly chosen me, Dad.

633
01:29:06.370 --> 01:29:07.450
把手给我  儿子
Give me your hand, man.

634
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:16.300
我要你听好  巴里
I want you to listen to me, Barry.

635
01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:19.970
我要你听好  我是认真的
I want you to listen to me, because I mean this.

636
01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:27.810
我要你放弃那一切
I want you to give all that up.

637
01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:33.860
我也要你别再来看我
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

638
01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:39.240
我拖累了你的人生
I am a drag on your life.

639
01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:45.780
好吧
Okay. Um...

640
01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:49.830
别再跟我这么说
Please don't ever say that to me again.

641
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:51.500
求求你
Please.

642
01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:54.790
你知道对我来说怎样才是最好吗
Hey, you know what criminal justice would be for me?

643
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.760
我儿子不白白浪费生命
My son not wasting his life.

644
01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:04.350
你想做什么都行  你聪明绝顶
You can be whatever you wanna be. You're brilliant, man.

645
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:09.680
你是精英中的精英
Absolute best of the best.

646
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.230
我不能坐在这儿  看着你在中城盲目地奔走
I can't sit here and watch you run in place in Central City

647
01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.150
就为了一个…
for some old dude

648
01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.490
哪儿都不能去的老头子
who's not going anywhere.

649
01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:22.990
-爸  并不是这样  -时间到了
-Dad, that's not true.  -It's time.

650
01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.160
并不是这样
That's not true.

651
01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.820
走吧  艾伦  艾伦
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

652
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:27.660
我要你创造自己的未来
I want you to make your own future.

653
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:29.500
别活在过去  创造自己的未来
You're living in the past. Make your own future.

654
01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.290
开门

655
01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:32.290

"别活在过去  创造自己的未来"
"You're living in the past. Make your own future, Barry."

657
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:40.300
可以了  开门
Clear. Close the gate.

658
01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:35.640
巴里·艾伦  我是布鲁斯·韦恩
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

659
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:40.440
你这么说似乎可以解释  为什么有个陌生人闯进我家
You said that like it explains why there's a total stranger in my place

660
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:43.400
摸黑坐在我第二喜欢的椅子
sitting in the dark, in my second favorite chair.

661
01:31:45.490 --> 01:31:47.280
请你解释一下
Tell me about this.

662
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:54.120
这家伙长得跟我一模一样
This is a person who looks exactly like me,

663
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:57.000
但绝对不是我

这个人…我不认识

披头散发的嬉皮

667
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:08.430
谁喝牛奶啊  我才不喝牛奶

669
01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:12.770
只是不知道是什么
I just don't know what they are.

670
01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:14.180
我的专长包括

是啊  我是冰舞竞技选手
Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

676
01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:31.870
这是用来避免  航天飞机重返大气层燃烧的材料
It's what they use on the space shuttle to prevent it from burning up on re-entry.

677
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:34.540
冰舞的竞争真的很激烈
I do very competitive ice dancing.

678
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:40.000
我不知道你是谁  不管你找的是谁

679
01:32:40.170 --> 01:32:41.170
都不是我
it's not me.

680
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.590
你是蝙蝠侠
You're the Batman?

681
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.760
所以你很快
So, you're fast.

682
01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:29.590
这么说感觉太平凡了
That feels like an oversimplification.

683
01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.510
我在组织一个团队

684
01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.760
寻找拥有特殊能力的人

685
01:33:33.930 --> 01:33:35.430
我相信敌人即将来袭

686
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.680
你不用多说  我参一脚

01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:52.320
我能留着吗
Can I keep this?

693
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:56.540
那就像是一层三次元现实  似乎能够操控时空
It's like this layer of dimensional reality, and it seems to manipulate space-time.

694
01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:57.910
我称之为神速力

701
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:14.890
上飞机再告诉你

702
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:16.720
飞机
Plane?

703
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:19.140
你的超能力是什么来着
What are your superpowers again?

704
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:21.020
我超有钱
I'm rich.

705
01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.920
普林斯小姐  让我来
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.

706
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:48.090
没关系  我自己来
No, that's okay. I can do it myself.

707
01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.760
你想要喝吗
Would you like to have some?

708
01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.220
不  谢了
Uh, no, thank you.

709
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:55.590
你得先倒水进去
If you put the water in first.

710
01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.310
-当然了  -才不会把茶叶烫熟
-Of course.  -So we don't scald the tea.

711
01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:03.770
-很好  -太好了
-Yes.  -Great.

712
01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.900
茶叶应该够多了
No, that's probably enough tea.

713
01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:07.440
好吧
All right.

714
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:10.070
你确定不来一杯
Are you sure you don't wanna have some?

715
01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:13.490
不  谢了  你得再让茶叶浸泡一下
I won't, thank you. And then leave it to mash.

716
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.030
我会的  一定会
I will. I will, definitely will.

717
01:35:18.450 --> 01:35:19.540
你在打造什么
Uh... What are you working on?

718
01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.040
这是一只手套
It's a gauntlet

719
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.250
布满高分子太阳能奈米电池
lined with specialized polymer solar cells.

720
01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.630
来  让我秀给你看
-Wow.  -Here, let me show you.

721
01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:31.130
这是从氪星侦察舰上借来的
We borrowed this from the Kryptonian scout ship.

722
01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.170
也许你应该…
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

723
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.800
-挪过去一点  谢谢  -没问题
a fraction. Thank you, thank you. Of course.

724
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:46.810
现在看看效果如何
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

725
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:48.730
好了
Ha! Yes.

726
01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.030
还不错喔
Not to be sneezed at.

727
01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:53.610
捕捉并消散能量的手套
A gauntlet that captures and dissipates energy.

728
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:55.280
这是韦恩少爷的点子
It's Master Wayne's idea.

729
01:35:55.570 --> 01:35:57.820
也许你也应该打造一条套索
Maybe you should work on a lasso, too?

730
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:59.740
当然是黑色的罗
-In black, of course.  -Oh.

731
01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:10.540
好吧  维克多斯通
-All right. Victor Stone.

732
01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:15.010
搜寻维克多·斯通

733
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:28.810
有点不对劲
Something is not working.

734
01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:34.740
在这里见面  现在

735
01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.040
看来你有个约会  普林斯小姐
Looks like you have a date, Miss Prince.

736
01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:43.180
你为什么找我  戴安娜
Why are you looking for me, Diana?

737
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:44.600
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

738
01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.100
我知道的远远超乎你想像
I know more than you can possibly imagine.

739
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:49.850
那也许你已经知道我需要你的帮助
Then maybe you already know I need your help.

740
01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.520
全世界都需要
The world does.

741
01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:54.610
去他的全世界
Fuck the world.

742
01:37:56.230 --> 01:37:58.610
你很显然经历了很多
You've obviously been through a great deal.

743
01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.360
我完全无法想像
I can't begin to imagine what.

744
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:06.450
但不管你发生什么事  现在都拥有超能力
But whatever happened to you, you have gifts now.

745
01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:08.410
超能力
Gifts?

746
01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:10.750
这看起来像是超能力吗
What part of this looks like a gift to you?

747
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:12.080
我们需要你  维克多
We need you, Victor.

748
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:14.340
也许你也需要我们
And maybe you need us.

749
01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.170
我不需要任何人
I don't need anyone.

750
01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:19.420
不再需要了
Not anymore.

751
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:22.090
我以前也一直这么告诉自己
I told myself the same for a long time.

752
01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:31.640
我曾经失去一个深爱的人
I lost someone I loved once.

753
01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:39.320
把自己封闭起来
I shut myself off from everyone.

754
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:43.660
但我得学会再次敞开心房
But I had to learn to open back up again.

755
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:49.790
老实说  我仍在努力中
The truth is, I'm still working on it.

756
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:53.170
既然你要求见我
And if you asked to meet me...

757
01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.790
你也在努力
you're working on it, too.

758
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:28.910
挚爱的儿子
维克多·斯通  1994-2015

759
01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.910
挚爱的母亲
爱莲诺·斯通  1973-2015

760
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:12.160
超人飞船上的金属样本被你说中了
You were right about the metal sample from the Superman ship.

761
01:40:12.330 --> 01:40:15.460
我们用电子激光向它轰射X光
When we bombard it with X-rays from the electron-laser,

762
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:17.330
看看发生了什么事
look what happens.

763
01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:28.260
克氏350万度
3.5 million kelvin.

764
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:31.390
金属的内核变得过热
The inner core of the metal becomes superheated.

765
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.890
形成又热又密的物质
Hot, dense matter.

766
01:40:37.190 --> 01:40:39.980
这是地球上最火热的东西
You're looking at the hottest thing on Earth.

767
01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:42.070
跟我对毕业舞会舞伴说的话一样
Exact words I said to my prom date.

768
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.980
但她还是甩了我
She dumped me anyway.

769
01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.360
是啊
Yeah.

770
01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:50.370
喂  博士
Hey, Doc,

771
01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:55.160
你认为蝙蝠侠和犯罪调查部  找的东西有关联吗
do you think Batman is connected to the object the CID is looking for?

772
01:40:56.210 --> 01:40:59.330
6-1-9-8-2号物件
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

773
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.590
不
No...

774
01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:03.800
我不这么认为
I don't.

775
01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.710
维克多
Oh, Victor.

776
01:41:57.850 --> 01:41:59.770
好了  走吧
All right! Let's go!

777
01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:02.610
-高登局长  -来吧
Commissioner Gordon? Come on!

778
01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:04.570
给你的留言
Your messages.

779
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.860
不用看也知道今天是满月
Don't have to see the sky to know it's a full moon.

780
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:14.870
哥谭市一半的疯子都出来了
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged community showed up.

781
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:17.200
他们都说看到怪物飞过港口
Say they saw flying monsters by the harbor.

782
01:42:17.370 --> 01:42:21.120
你是对的  老妈  金牌警校军  念牙医学院有什么不好
You were right, Ma. Police Academy. What's wrong with dental school?

783
01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:26.500
"遭到飞行吸血鬼攻击"
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

784
01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:30.470
"看起来像是一口尖牙的巨大蝙蝠"
"Looked like a giant bat with huge fangs."

785
01:42:30.630 --> 01:42:32.430
有一个相关的线索
On a possibly related note,

786
01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:36.180
实验室绑架案的嫌犯肖像素描
sketch of the suspect in the abductions at the lab across the harbor.

787
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:38.890
-看起来像…  -我知道像什么
-Looks like...  -I know what it looks like, Crispus.

788
01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:42.560
拜托  你觉得他在这里打击犯罪20年
Come on, you think he fights criminals for 20 years here

789
01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:45.400
然后跑去大都会绑架八个人
and then he goes to Metropolis and kidnaps eight people?

790
01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.520
我今晚会找他谈谈
I'll talk to him tonight.

791
01:42:47.690 --> 01:42:49.230
怎么找他
How, Jim?

792
01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.860
你说呢
How do you think?

793
01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:10.340
塞拉斯
Silas?

794
01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:20.270
-天啊  -钢骨在哪里
-Oh, my goodness.  -Where's the cyborg?

795
01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:21.600
他叫维克多
His name is Victor.

796
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:25.150
我们见过面  说过话
We met, spoke.

797
01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:27.520
给他点时间
Give him time.

798
01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.280
你一定是巴里  我是戴安娜
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

799
01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:34.200
你好  巴里  我是戴安娜  那不太对  好极了
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana. That's not right. Great.

800
01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.360
就只有我们
-So, this is us.

801
01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:36.490
没错  就只有我们
-Yeah, this is us.

802
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:40.870
酷啊  那是蝙蝠信号  那是在…
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal. That's your...

803
01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.120
抱歉  那是在呼叫你
Oh, sorry. That's your signal.

804
01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:44.500
意思是我们得出动了
That means we have to go now.

805
01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:47.710
-对  是这意思没错  -酷毙了
-Yeah, that's what that means.  -It's so cool.

806
01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:49.270
湄拉指挥官  我告诉海王  外围守卫被掳走
Commander Mera, I told the king the perimeter guards were taken.

807
01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:51.020
他不会派出援兵
He won't send reinforcements.

808
01:44:51.190 --> 01:44:53.820
他说所有的士兵  都必须前往叛军地区支持
He says all the reserves are needed in the rebel regions.

809
01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.700
他不但残忍而且短视
He's as shortsighted as he is cruel.

810
01:44:58.410 --> 01:44:59.990
好吧  带着剩下的人马
All right, take what men we have left

811
01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.330
在母盒周围形成方阵
and form a phalanx around the Mother Box.

812
01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.800
你逃不了的
You can't escape.

813
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:46.510
我并不想逃
I'm not trying to.

814
01:48:49.090 --> 01:48:50.970
维科跟我说你会来
Vulko told me you would come.

815
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:54.180
备受爱戴的亚特兰娜女王的长子
The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna.

816
01:48:56.810 --> 01:48:58.100
等一下
Wait.

817
01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:01.190
拜托了
Please.

818
01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:06.110
我认识她
I knew her.

819
01:49:08.410 --> 01:49:09.990
你至少认识她
Well, that makes one of us.

820
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:12.450
我父母死于战争
My parents died in the wars.

821
01:49:14.370 --> 01:49:15.580
她收容了我
She took me in.

822
01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.210
还真是个圣人
What a saint.

823
01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.040
你胆敢讽刺亚特兰娜女王
You dare speak of Queen Atlanna that way?

824
01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:22.840
你的女王把我丢在我父亲家门口
Your queen left me on my father's doorstep

825
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.590
从此把我忘得一干二净
and never gave me another thought.

826
01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.970
你母亲是为了救你才离开
Your mother left you to save your life.

827
01:49:28.090 --> 01:49:30.550
你无法想像她有多心痛
You cannot imagine how it hurt her.

828
01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.180
她也付出惨痛代价
What it cost her.

829
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:37.600
但你现在不是脆弱的小孩
But you're not a defenseless child now.

830
01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.610
那本是她的责任
It would have been her responsibility

831
01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:44.940
跟着那怪物到陆地  然后阻止他
to follow that monster to the surface and stop him.

832
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:46.610
现在
Now,

833
01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:49.240
是你的责任
it's yours.

834
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:55.050
太好了
Yes.

835
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:19.370
荒原狼
Steppenwolf,

836
01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.460
告诉我你知道了什么
tell me what you've learned.

837
01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:24.250
找到两个苏醒的母盒
Two boxes found and awake.

838
01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:27.380
结合两个母盒的力量
With the combined power of the two Mother Boxes,

839
01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.550
我完成了要塞的防御系统
I've been able to finish the stronghold's defenses.

840
01:51:30.710 --> 01:51:33.130
第三个母盒在哪里
Where is the third Mother Box?

841
01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:37.430
天启魔感应到它  正在寻找它
The parademons sense its presence and search for the third.

842
01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:38.600
它们抓来了囚犯
They have taken prisoners

843
01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.850
他们带有它的气味
who carry its scent.

844
01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.640
去吧
Go.

845
01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.400
去审问囚犯
Interrogate the prisoners.

846
01:51:46.190 --> 01:51:48.070
找到第三个母盒
Find the third.

847
01:51:49.610 --> 01:51:51.780
他们会乖乖告诉我
They will tell me what they know,

848
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:55.530
不然我就来硬的
or I will rip it from them.

849
01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.420
第四章

850
01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.420
“改造机器”

851
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:40.450
你们有多少人
How many of you are there?

852
01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:42.410
还不够多
Not enough.

853
01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.750
哥谭市各地有数十名目击者
Dozens of witnesses all over Gotham.

854
01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.630
他们的描述符合大都会绑架案的嫌犯
Description matches the suspect in the Metropolis abductions.

855
01:52:50.210 --> 01:52:51.250
天启魔
Parademons.

856
01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:53.130
好吧
Okay.

857
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:55.630
天启魔一定闻到母盒的气味
The demons must have caught the scent of a Mother Box.

858
01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:56.880
在实验室的那个
At the lab.

859
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:59.390
它们把人抓走  拷问母盒下落
They carried people away to find out what they know.

860
01:52:59.550 --> 01:53:01.260
-那八个人可能还活着  -九个人
So the eight may still be alive. Nine.

861
01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.310
星辰实验室的主任今晚被绑走
The head of STARLABS was taken tonight.

862
01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:14.070
好吧  另一个科学家
Wow, okay. So, another scientist.

863
01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:15.530
我们要怎么找到他
So, how do we find him?

864
01:53:15.690 --> 01:53:17.360
附近一定有它们的巢穴
There must be a nest nearby.

865
01:53:17.530 --> 01:53:21.620
我在大都会和哥谭市地图上做记号
I plotted all the sightings in Metropolis, Gotham.

866
01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:23.910
看不出任何模式
No discernable pattern I can see.

867
01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.370
地图上的路线没有交集
The lines on the map don't converge.

868
01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:26.870
在陆地上没有
On land.

869
01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.630
这是在两座城市之间的史崔克岛
These lead back to Stryker's Island, between the two cities.

870
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:32.210
这些是通风口  全都通往1929年
These are air vents. They all lead down to the tunnel

871
01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:34.760
废弃的大都会工程隧道
to a Metropolis project that was abandoned in '29.

872
01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:36.510
巢穴可能在那里
The nest could be there.

873
01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:39.220
他要跟我们一起去吗
Uh, is he coming with us now,

874
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:40.720
因为你的车子坐不下
because we're not all gonna fit in your car.

875
01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:42.680
我有更大的玩意儿
I have something bigger.

876
01:53:44.010 --> 01:53:45.640
你真的觉得…
Do you really think that...

877
01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:50.520
他们就这样闪人了吗
Oh, wow, they just... They really just vanish, huh?

878
01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:53.070
太没礼貌了
Oh. That's rude.

879
01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:31.600
星辰实验室

880
01:54:31.770 --> 01:54:33.860
很接近了
We're close.

881
01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:36.030
敌人的气味
The scent of the enemy.

882
01:54:36.730 --> 01:54:37.900
虚无
Of absence.

883
01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:40.030
黑暗
Darkness.

884
01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:41.740
死亡
Death.

885
01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.410
-我们在哪里  阿尔弗雷德  -史崔克岛
Where are we, Alfred? Stryker's Island.

886
01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:49.120
你们应该就在隧道通风塔的正下方
You should be directly under the venting tower for the tunnel.

887
01:54:49.710 --> 01:54:53.130
往左看  应该有一道阶梯通往机械室
Now look to your left, you'll see a staircase to the machine room.

888
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:55.880
红外线热影像显示有一群人
Thermal scan shows a cluster of people there.

889
01:54:56.050 --> 01:54:56.960
就是那里
That's it.

890
01:54:57.340 --> 01:54:58.340
走吧
Let's go.

891
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:13.190
好吧
Right.

892
01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.270
有任何计划吗
Is there... Is there a plan?

893
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:18.110
你们两个
Either of you?

894
01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.440
别单打独斗
Don't engage alone.

895
01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.490
我们要联手出击
We do this together.

896
01:55:30.450 --> 01:55:32.290
我听说过你
I heard about you.

897
01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.250
没想到你是真的
Didn't think you were real.

898
01:55:35.710 --> 01:55:37.250
有用的时候我就是真的
I'm real when it's useful.

899
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:51.640
我受够了你们的沉默  快告诉我  母盒在哪里
I grow tired of your silence. Now tell me, where is the Mother Box?

900
01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.650
求求你  我们有家人
Please. We have families.

901
01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.900
那你们就有弱点
Then you have weakness.

902
01:56:03.070 --> 01:56:04.530
荒原狼
Steppenwolf.

903
01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:08.870
好吧  我猜…那就是坏蛋
Okay, I'm guessing that's the bad guy.

904
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:10.080
猜对了
Good guess.

905
01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:14.080
我现在真的超想念超人
I'm really, really missing Superman right now.

906
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:16.420
绕到另一边
Circle to the other side.

907
01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:18.590
把它们团团围住展开突袭
We'll surround them and surprise him.

908
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:24.720
你接近过一个母盒
You have been near a Mother Box.

909
01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:26.890
身上有它的气味
The scent is on you.

910
01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:28.510
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

911
01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:30.510
-它在哪里  -放过他
-Where is it?  -Leave him alone!

912
01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:32.930
他不知道
He... He doesn't know.

913
01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.310
等等  求求你
Wait, please, please!

914
01:56:43.490 --> 01:56:46.610
你也带着气味  但是更强烈
You carry the scent, too. But stronger.

915
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:49.120
我死也不会告诉你
I will die before I tell you.

916
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.120
不告诉我就会死
You'll die if you don't.

917
01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:52.540
不
No!

918
01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:02.920
维克多
Victor.

919
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:04.380
杀了他们
Kill them both.

920
01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.010
亚马逊女战士
Ah, Amazon.

921
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:12.930
但不像你的姐妹
But not like your sisters.

922
01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:14.350
你更强大
Stronger.

923
01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:46.920
亚马逊女战士
Amazon.

924
01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:51.350
住手
Hold!

925
01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:53.930
这一个是我的
This one will be mine.

926
01:57:55.890 --> 01:57:58.310
我不属于任何人
I belong to no one.

927
01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.370
大伙儿  这不是联手出击
Guys, this is not together.

928
01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:22.540
把这些人救出去
Help get those people out of here.

929
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:24.380
我会让这些怪物跟着我
I'll make sure these things follow me.

930
01:58:34.810 --> 01:58:36.220
大伙儿  快啊
Everybody, move!

931
01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:46.480
再快一点
A little quicker.

932
01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:50.240
-没事吧  -没事
-Are you good?  -Yeah.

933
01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.820
我会搞定  动作快点
I've got this. Keep moving.

934
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:55.870
这里
This way.

935
01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.610
能量正在消散
The energy is dissipating.

936
01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:35.280
我的手套很有用
My gauntlet worked!

937
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:38.830
晚点再庆祝  阿尔弗雷德  我需要夜蝠战机
Celebrate later, Alfred. I need the Nightcrawler.

938
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:40.620
我以为你不会开口
Thought you'd never ask.

939
01:59:41.210 --> 01:59:43.330
马上赶去  启动遥控模式
Crawler's on the way. Initiating remote mode.

940
02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:14.490
谢了  阿尔弗雷德
Thank you, Alfred.

941
02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:16.070
不客气
Don't mention it.

942
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:39.760
惨了
No!

943
02:00:47.770 --> 02:00:49.230
他们安全了  回去隧道
They're safe. Get back to the tunnel.

944
02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:52.480
隧道  好  外星人  坏蛋  耍剑的女士
Tunnel. Right. Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

945
02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:05.660

系统全面故障

948

949
02:02:44.010 --> 02:02:47.520
你身上流着旧神族的血液
You have the blood of the old gods in you.

950
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.820
你没事吧
You okay?

951
02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:06.450
我不确定你会来
Wasn't sure you'd come.

952
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:08.790
你是我父亲
You're my father.

953
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:13.290
快去吧
Go.

954
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:27.930
不要
No!

955
02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:15.770
放轻松  阿尔弗雷德  我来接手
Relax, Alfred. I'll take it from here.

956
02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:19.190
我认识你吗
Uh, do I know you?

957
02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:51.350
我们在哪里的下面
What are we under, right now?

958
02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:53.390
哥谭港
Gotham Harbor.

959
02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:33.390
那是谁
Who is that?

02:05:58.710 --> 02:05:59.880
快点
Come on.

961

它在这里
It is here.

965
02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:03.330
在这个世界
On this world.

966
02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:40.200
你可能感染了外星微生物  必须接受隔离
Sir, you're gonna be in quarantine for possible alien microbes.

967
02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:42.040
美国政府的规定要求…
U.S. government protocols require that...

968
02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:45.000
我知道规定  是我写的
I know the requirements. I wrote them.

969
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:50.880
它召唤了他
It called to him.

970
02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:52.590
母盒
The Mother Box.

971
02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:54.130
他抢走的那个
The one he already has.

972
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:57.510
他有两个了  他从亚特兰蒂斯抢走母盒
He has two. He took the Mother Box from Atlantis.

973
02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.970
现在只需要人类遗失的母盒
All he needs now is the lost Box of Men.

974
02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:01.310
他可能已经拿到手了
If he doesn't already have it.

975
02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:06.400
他没有拿到手
He doesn't have it.

976
02:09:09.610 --> 02:09:10.770
在我这里
I do.

977
02:09:21.330 --> 02:09:23.410
你完成征服行动了吗
Have you finished the conquest?

978
02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:24.830
还没有  狄萨德
Not yet, DeSaad.

979
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.250
那你为何召唤我
Then why do you summon me?

980
02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:29.080
我带来消息
I bring news.

981
02:09:29.250 --> 02:09:32.170
强大的达克赛德登上王位之前
Before mighty Darkseid came to the throne,

982
02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:36.840
他在全宇宙搜寻终极武器
he searched the universe for the ultimate weapon.

983
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:39.640
反生命方程序
The Anti-Life Equation.

984
02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:44.480
掌控多重宇宙中  所有生命与自由意志的关键
The key to controlling all life and all will throughout the multiverse.

985
02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:47.650
他发现它被藏在一个原始星球上  但在他还没…
He found it hidden on a primitive planet, but before...

986
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:50.690
大家都知道你背叛了他
The story of the defiance is well-known.

987
02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:53.360
我找到了那个原始星球
I have found the primitive planet.

988
02:09:53.530 --> 02:09:55.570
胆敢反击的世界
The world that fought back.

989
02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:57.610
就是地球
It is Earth.

990
02:09:57.780 --> 02:09:59.990
反生命方程序被刻在…
The Anti-Life Equation is carved

991
02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:04.040
这个世界的地表
into the surface of this very world.

992
02:10:07.710 --> 02:10:09.120
你确定
Are you certain?

993
02:10:09.290 --> 02:10:10.330
我看到了
I have seen it.

994
02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:13.920
我亲眼看到了
I have looked with my own eyes.

995
02:10:57.260 --> 02:10:58.840
主人
My lord.

996
02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:03.930
荒原狼
Oh, Steppenwolf.

997
02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.680
主人  我只是你谦卑的仆人
My lord, I am but your humble servant.

998
02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:11.520
你真的找到它了
Can it be true that you have found it?

999
02:11:11.690 --> 02:11:13.860
是的  霸主
I have, great one.

1000
02:11:14.610 --> 02:11:17.570
失落的世界就是地球
The lost world is Earth.

1001
02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:20.740
反生命方程序就在这里
Anti-Life is here.

1002
02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:25.410
你若想寻求救赎  那就找到第三个母盒
If it is redemption you seek, find the third box,

1003
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:28.540
合而为一形成三位一体  当这世界化为焦土
synchronize The Unity, and when this world is scorched,

1004
02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:31.920
我就会来拿我的大奖
I will come for my great prize.

1005
02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:35.090
你会来地球
You will come to Earth?

1006
02:11:36.130 --> 02:11:40.380
我已经把十万个世界化为尘土
I have turned 100,000 worlds to dust

1007
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:42.050
寻找反生命方程序
looking for Anti-Life.

1008
02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:45.430
寻找抢走我荣耀之人
Looking for those who robbed me of my glory.

1009
02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:51.350
我将踏着他们的骨骸  沐浴在反生命方程序的荣光中
I will stride across their bones and bask in the glow of Anti-Life.

1010
02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:54.230
所有的生命
And all of existence

1011
02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.900
都将是我的
shall be mine.

1012
02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:05.200
一定会的  主人
It shall be so, my master.

1013
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:11.080
酷爆了
So cool.

1014
02:12:11.250 --> 02:12:13.790
从外面看  这只是一栋废弃建筑物
From the outside, it looks like this building was abandoned.

1015
02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:19.300
它想要飞行
It wants to fly.

1016
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:22.380
你和机器说话
You talk to machines?

1017
02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:24.680
我和人工智能说话
I speak to intelligence.

1018
02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:27.720
这个说她因为软体问题不能飞
This one's saying she can't fly because of a software issue,

1019
02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:29.850
不过我很快就能修好
but I could fix it with a little time.

1020
02:12:39.610 --> 02:12:41.820
我的数据流中有个黑点
There's a dark spot in my data stream.

1021
02:12:42.150 --> 02:12:44.410
我能感应到另外两个母盒
I could feel the other two boxes.

1022
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:46.410
我知道它们苏醒了
I know they're awake,

1023
02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:48.080
但是看不见它们在哪里
but I can't see where they are.

1024
02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:50.240
知道敌方基地在哪里才能攻击
Well, we can't attack unless we know where the base is.

1025
02:12:50.410 --> 02:12:52.660
就算我们知道
Even if we knew,

1026
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:55.670
也没有比荒原狼更强大的生物
I've never seen a being as strong as Steppenwolf.

1027
02:12:57.880 --> 02:12:59.250
也许有一个
Maybe one.

1028
02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:01.010
超人
Hmm, Superman.

1029
02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:05.970
只要第三个母盒在沉睡  他们就看不到它  只能感应到它
As long as the third box is asleep, they can't see it, only sense it.

1030
02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:08.180
我们得不断移动才不会被发现
We need to keep moving so they can't catch up.

1031
02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:11.520
不  这只是延缓失败的策略  不是获胜的战略
No. That's just a strategy to lose more slowly, not to win.

1032
02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:14.140
难道火焰喷射器不流行了吗
Remind me, are flamethrowers not a thing?

1033
02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.100
为何不直接烧毁它
Why don't we just destroy it?

1034
02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:18.360
烈火也无法摧毁母盒
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1035
02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.270
它们是一种未知的物质
They're an unknown form of matter.

1036
02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:23.900
喜欢热能  会吸收它  保存在它们的核心
Oh, they love heat. They absorb it, hold it in their cores.

1037
02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:26.200
你很了解这些盒子嘛
Well, you know a lot about these boxes.

1038
02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:28.030
非常可疑
Makes you think.

1039
02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.910
你在哪里找到母盒
Where'd you find the box, Victor?

1040
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:32.290
你在怀疑我吗
Are you trying to say something?

1041
02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:34.080
我就是怀疑你
Oh, I'm saying it.

1042
02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.540
我们怎么知道你不是他们的奸细
How do we know you're not working for them?

1043
02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:40.090
说来话长
It's a long story.

1044
02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:42.460
你赶着要去哪儿吗
You got somewhere else to be?

1045
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:53.680
纳粹在二战结束前找到母盒
The Nazis found the box at the end of the Second World War,

1046
02:13:53.850 --> 02:13:56.890
它被埋在一座义大利修道院底下
buried under an Italian monastery.

1047
02:13:57.060 --> 02:13:59.440
被送去给希特勒的路上  遭到盟军拦截
The Allies intercepted it on its way to Hitler.

1048
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:01.820
1944年被带回了美国
They brought it back to the States in '44.

1049
02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:05.950
6-1-9-8-2号未知物件
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1050
02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:10.280
它被丢在五角大厦档案室七十年
It collected dust in the Pentagon archives for 70 years

1051
02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:14.040
直到国防部开始研究超人飞船
till DoD began to study the Superman ship.

1052
02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:19.080
星辰实验室的一位研究员  发现超人飞船和…
A researcher at STARLABS made a connection between the ship...

1053
02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:21.920
6-1-9-8-2号物件有关联
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1054
02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:25.630
他了解到它们都是外星科技
He understood they were both alien technologies.

1055
02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:27.880
不同的文明
Different civilizations,

1056
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:30.590
类似的属性
similar properties.

1057
02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:34.680
虽然母盒已经沉睡了几千年
And though the box had slept for thousands of years,

1058
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:38.190
那位研究员想出  一个可以唤醒它的理论
the researcher formulated a theory on how to awaken it.

1059
02:14:38.810 --> 02:14:40.560
也真的唤醒了它
And so did.

1060
02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:43.860
后来…
Then...

1061
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:47.900
我出了车祸  本来应该死去
I had an accident that should've killed me.

1062
02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:52.450
但是出于绝望或是疯狂
But in an act of desperation or madness,

1063
02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:54.950
那位研究员驾驭了母盒的力量
the researcher harnessed the power of the Mother Box.

1064
02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:13.220
释放了一种他无法…
He unleashed an alien technology

1065
02:15:13.390 --> 02:15:16.060
完全理解的外星科技
he didn't fully understand.

1066
02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:18.600
他利用那股力量让我活下来
He used that power to keep me alive.

1067
02:15:22.190 --> 02:15:23.770
活着…
Alive...

1068
02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.280
但变成了这样
but turned into this.

1069
02:15:29.070 --> 02:15:31.360
母盒继续沉睡
The box went back to sleep

1070
02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:33.950
他也没有物归原处
and he never returned it.

1071
02:15:36.580 --> 02:15:38.620
那位研究员就是塞拉斯·斯通
That researcher was Silas Stone.

1072
02:15:40.330 --> 02:15:42.000
我的父亲
My father.

1073
02:15:45.290 --> 02:15:46.960
等等
Wait,

1074
02:15:47.130 --> 02:15:50.510
你父亲用一个母盒救了你一命
your father saved your life with one of these things?

1075
02:15:50.670 --> 02:15:52.890
它们不是变态杀人机器吗
Aren't they psycho murder machines?

1076
02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:55.430
它们是改造机器
They're change machines.

1077
02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:58.270
母盒没有救人或杀人…
The boxes don't think in terms of healing or killing,

1078
02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:00.770
活着或死亡的概念
alive or dead.

1079
02:16:00.930 --> 02:16:03.190
它们按照主人的意愿重新排列物质
They rearrange matter at the will of their masters,

1080
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:04.940
使其再生  恢复原状
regenerate, reinstate.

1081
02:16:05.110 --> 02:16:06.520
恢复原状
Reinstate?

1082
02:16:06.690 --> 02:16:10.110
母盒拥有恢复粒子相互作用的力量
A box has the power to reinstate anterior particle relationships.

1083
02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:13.360
你是说任何物质的粒子  都不能被创造或毁灭
So, you mean in the way that particles of matter can't be created or destroyed,

1084
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:15.530
它们的相互作用只会转变
their relations just transform.

1085
02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:18.450
烧掉一栋房子  粒子仍然存在
Burn down a house, the particles still exist.

1086
02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:21.080
房子的粒子变成灰烬的粒子
Particles of house become particles of smoke.

1087
02:16:21.250 --> 02:16:25.290
任何人只要有火柴  都能把一栋房子化成灰烬
Anybody with a match can turn a house to smoke.

1088
02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:29.090
但是一个母盒
But a Mother Box...

1089
02:16:29.250 --> 02:16:31.470
能够把灰烬变回一栋房子
...turns smoke back into a house.

1090
02:16:37.470 --> 02:16:39.970
我知道我们都在想同样的事
I know we're all thinking the same thing right now.

1091
02:16:41.430 --> 02:16:43.940
谁要说我才不说
Who's gonna say it? I'm not gonna say it.

1092
02:17:11.210 --> 02:17:12.300
谁啊
Who is it?

1093
02:17:13.010 --> 02:17:14.220
玛莎
Martha.

1094
02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:37.570
我去了星球日报  终于拿回克拉克的东西
I went to the Daily Planet to finally pick up Clark's things.

1095
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:42.370
不知道为什么  现在无处可放
I don't know why, nowhere to put them now.

1096
02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:46.790
我失去了农场
I lost the farm.

1097
02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:50.540
我迟缴房贷好一阵子了
I'd been behind on the payments for a while.

1098
02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:55.800
老实说  那房子我一个人住太大了
Truth is, the house is too big for me to live in by myself anyway.

1099
02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:59.140
你知道我随时都欢迎你来住
Well, you know you're welcome to stay here any time

1100
02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:01.260
只要你需要的话
for as long as you need.

1101
02:18:02.470 --> 02:18:05.100
谢谢你  露易丝  你真好心
Thank you, Lois. That's very kind.

1102
02:18:06.770 --> 02:18:08.850
但我找到一个小地方  我一个人住刚好
But I've found a little place that suits me just fine,

1103
02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:10.480
就在餐馆旁边
right by the diner.

1104
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:12.480
我不是来求助的
I'm not here for help.

1105
02:18:13.650 --> 02:18:15.530
我来是因为…
I'm here because

1106
02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:18.780
我见到派瑞先生  他跟我说…
when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that

1107
02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:23.160
克拉克死后你就没去上班了
you haven't been to work since Clark died.

1108
02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:29.580
我办不到
I can't.

1109
02:18:36.470 --> 02:18:38.800
全世界都在哀悼
The whole world is mourning.

1110
02:18:40.430 --> 02:18:42.850
为了一个象征悲伤
Grieving over a symbol.

1111
02:18:43.010 --> 02:18:46.810
我走到哪儿都看到那个"S"
Everywhere I go, everywhere I look, I see that "S."

1112
02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:49.940
也听到人们在说什么
I hear what people say.

1113
02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:51.940
好像他们都认识他
They talk like they knew him.

1114
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:55.400
但是他们不认识克拉克
But they didn't know Clark.

1115
02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:59.280
我不能拦住他们
And I can't stop them

1116
02:18:59.450 --> 02:19:00.820
看着他们跟他们说
and look at them

1117
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:03.740
我为我儿子感到多么骄傲
and tell them how proud I am of my son.

1118
02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:08.250
只有你知道
You're the only one who knows.

1119
02:19:08.410 --> 02:19:10.830
也只有你能体会
Who feels what I do.

1120
02:19:12.170 --> 02:19:15.130
悲伤加上秘密的负担
Burdened by a secret on top of grief.

1121
02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:21.590
我大老远跑来是因为我想…
I came all this way because I wanted...

1122
02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:23.760
因为我想来见你
because I wanted to see you.

1123
02:19:25.010 --> 02:19:26.970
告诉你
Tell you...

1124
02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:28.980
我能体会
I understand.

1125
02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:31.980
我…
I...

1126
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:36.820
永远都不会像爱你儿子那样爱任何人
will never love anybody the way that I love your son.

1127
02:19:40.570 --> 02:19:42.570
我也很想念他
And I just miss him.

1128
02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:45.950
我好想他啊
I miss him so much.

1129
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:54.340
我也是  亲爱的
So do I, sweetheart.

1130
02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:03.800
玛莎  你有任何需要我都会帮忙
Martha, you know if there's anything you need, I'm here.

1131
02:20:07.390 --> 02:20:09.980
你可以帮我一个忙  亲爱的
There is something you can do for me, honey.

1132
02:20:12.390 --> 02:20:14.650
继续过活吧
Come back to the living.

1133
02:20:54.650 --> 02:20:57.480
这世界也需要你  露易丝
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1134
02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:02.440
他人都死了
The dead are dead.

1135
02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:04.530
母盒让维克多死而复生
The box brought Victor back.

1136
02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:06.240
维克多并没有死
Victor wasn't dead.

1137
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:08.160
生命不是一就是零
Life is either one or zero.

1138
02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:11.250
不是生就是死  不能两者都是
It's to be or not to be. Not both.

1139
02:21:11.410 --> 02:21:13.080
你能操作母盒吗  维克多
Can you operate this box, Victor?

1140
02:21:13.250 --> 02:21:14.120
当然了
Of course.

1141
02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:16.960
但我们不够了解氪星生物学
But we don't know enough about Kryptonian biology.

1142
02:21:17.130 --> 02:21:18.960
谁知道会发生什么事
There's no telling what's gonna happen.

1143
02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:22.420
好吧  不过…
--Okay, but...

1144
02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:26.220
我们总得试试  对吧  我们得试试看
I mean, we have to try. Don't we? We have to try.

1145
02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:27.930
还有什么好顾忌的
What do we have to lose?

1146
02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:30.640
必须唤醒母盒才能尝试
We cannot try unless we activate the box.

1147
02:21:30.810 --> 02:21:32.270
它一旦苏醒
As soon as it wakes up...

1148
02:21:32.430 --> 02:21:34.810
敌人就会看到  然后闯进来
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1149
02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:37.520
完成三位一体  世界末日来临
activates The Unity. The end.

1150
02:21:37.690 --> 02:21:40.070
我们会把整个地球…
So, what we have to lose is the entire planet

1151
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:42.070
拱手让给想灭绝人类的外星人  这真是好消息
to a bunch of genocidal aliens. That's good to know.

1152
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:44.860
就算超人能回来
Even if Superman could return,

1153
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:46.910
谁敢说他就能打败他们
who's to say that he could defeat them?

1154
02:21:47.070 --> 02:21:48.950
母盒这么说
The Mother Box did.

1155
02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:52.490
维克多的父亲  一年多前启动一个母盒
Victor's father activated a Mother Box

1156
02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:54.410
当时超人还活着
more than a year ago when Superman was still alive.

1157
02:21:54.580 --> 02:21:58.000
它没召唤荒原狼  没有母盒召唤他  直到…
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf. None of the boxes did. Not until...

1158
02:21:58.170 --> 02:22:00.250
直到超人死后
Not until Superman died.

1159
02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:02.840
直到超人死后
Not until Superman died.

1160
02:22:03.010 --> 02:22:05.550
-因为他们怕他  -没错
It's like they were afraid of him? Yes,

1161
02:22:06.130 --> 02:22:07.930
他们怕他
they were afraid of him.

1162
02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:12.640
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

1163
02:22:14.310 --> 02:22:18.060
这团队有六个人  不是五个人  没有他就没有我们
There are six, not five. There is no us without him.

1164
02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:33.260
第五章

1165
02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:33.260
国王人马

1166
02:22:34.450 --> 02:22:36.410
又完成了一项遗愿清单任务
Cross this one off the bucket list.

1167
02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:40.380
把超人从坟墓里挖出来  搞定
Exhume Superman from the grave. Check.

1168
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:42.250
克拉克·乔瑟夫·肯特

1169
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.840
你知道我们能在一奈秒内搞定  对吧
You know we could do this in a nanosecond, right?

1170
02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:46.920
没错
We could.

1171
02:22:54.470 --> 02:22:56.100
他是我的偶像
He was my hero.

1172
02:22:58.730 --> 02:22:59.940
好吧
All right.

1173
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:06.610
亚马逊人和亚特兰蒂斯人并肩作战
An Amazon working with an Atlantean.

1174
02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:08.030
半亚特兰蒂斯人
Half-Atlantean.

1175
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:12.660
我们的族人有几千年没说过话了
How many thousands of years since our people spoke?

1176
02:23:13.330 --> 02:23:16.200
不知道  我和我的族人不亲
I don't know. I'm not exactly close to mine.

1177
02:23:17.410 --> 02:23:20.120
我跟亚马逊人一样讨厌亚特兰蒂斯人
I hate Atlanteans as much as you Amazons do.

1178
02:23:20.290 --> 02:23:22.330
互相仇恨真的很没必要
Hate is useless.

1179
02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:26.800
是啊
Yep.

1180
02:23:28.090 --> 02:23:29.680
不  谢了
No, thank you.

1181
02:23:34.220 --> 02:23:37.180
我父亲告诉我亚特兰蒂斯有句老话
You know, my father told me there's a saying in Atlantis...

1182
02:23:38.930 --> 02:23:41.230
"只要从黑暗中拿回什么
"None are taken back from the darkness.

1183
02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:44.020
"-就一定要…  -就一定要付出代价"
"Not without...Not without giving one up in return."

1184
02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:47.860
我们也会这么说
We say the same thing.

1185
02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:51.820
真没想到
How about that?

1186
02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:54.200
神力女超人
Wonder Woman.

1187
02:23:55.740 --> 02:23:59.540
你觉得怎样  她会不会喜欢一个小鲜肉
What do you think, man? You think she'd ever go for a younger guy?

1188
02:23:59.910 --> 02:24:02.500
她都五千岁了  巴里
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1189
02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:06.210
每个男人都是小鲜肉
Every guy's a younger guy.

1190
02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:09.050
天啊
Jesus.

1191
02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:12.510
真是的
Oh, Christ.

1192
02:24:15.850 --> 02:24:17.470
该死
-Oh, bloody...

1193
02:24:18.850 --> 02:24:19.850
运气怎么样
Any luck?

1194
02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:21.100
如果你说的"运气"是指…
If by "luck" you mean

1195
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:24.360
"今天能不能让它飞起来的运气"
"chance in hell we'll get it flying today,"

1196
02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:26.520
那就没有
then, no. No luck.

1197
02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:28.940
没关系
It's okay.

1198
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:30.820
无所谓  我们只要把尸体
It doesn't matter. We're just gonna take the body

1199
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:33.240
放进氪星飞船  它基本上是一台有机电脑
to the Kryptonian ship. It's basically an organic computer.

1200
02:24:33.410 --> 02:24:35.410
可以直接和母盒讲话
It can talk directly to the Mother Box.

1201
02:24:35.570 --> 02:24:38.040
什么  就像它跟莱克斯·卢瑟讲话
What? The way it talked to Lex Luthor?

1202
02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:39.240
差不多吧
Something like that.

1203
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:43.250
还会出什么差错
Huh. What could possibly go wrong?

1204
02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:51.380
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne...

1205
02:24:53.470 --> 02:24:54.680
你成功了
you did it!

1206
02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:58.350
你组成了团队  一起打这场仗
You put the team together to fight this war.

1207
02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:00.850
你实现了承诺
You've fulfilled your promise.

1208
02:25:01.930 --> 02:25:05.350
但是想让超人死而复生  我是说…
But to try to do that... I mean...

1209
02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:07.820
你的罪恶感超过了理性
your guilt's overcome your reason.

1210
02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:11.150
再多的国王人马都办不到
Not all the king's horses nor all the king's men...

1211
02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:14.410
阿尔弗雷德  我这次完全凭靠信念
Alfred, for once, I'm operating strictly on faith,

1212
02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:16.410
而不是理性
not on reason.

1213
02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:21.410
但如果你开始玩弄这个母盒
But if you start playing with this little box of tricks,

1214
02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:23.660
可能会是一切的终结
I mean, it could be the end of everything.

1215
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:25.710
你怎么知道你的团队够强大
How do you know your team's strong enough?

1216
02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:29.300
制伏不了冲过来的公牛
If you can't bring down the charging bull,

1217
02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:31.170
就不要挥舞红色披风
then don't wave the red cape at it.

1218
02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:32.920
是这个红色披风就可以
You do when it's this red cape.

1219
02:25:33.090 --> 02:25:35.260
红色披风会冲回去
This red cape charges back.

1220
02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:51.150
好吧
Okay.

1221
02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:00.490
你是对的  斯通博士  检验报告是阴性
You were right, Dr. Stone. The tests came back negative.

1222
02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:02.290
大家都没事  包括你在内
Everyone's clear, including you.

1223
02:26:02.450 --> 02:26:05.040
但为了安全起见  我们扫遍了整间实验室
Just to be on the safe side, we swept the entire facility.

1224
02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:06.960
谢谢你  汤玛斯  所以我可以走了吗
Well, thank you, Thomas. That means I'm free to go?

1225
02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:07.960
当然了
Absolutely.

1226
02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:13.260
-谢了  -大家听好
-Thanks.  -Listen up, everyone.

1227
02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:15.880
你们都没事了  收拾你们的东西
You're all clear. So, gather your things.

1228
02:26:16.050 --> 02:26:17.590
如果需要更多医疗照顾…
If you need more medical attention...

1229
02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:21.430
亚瑟  我问你  哪个比较低调  选项"A"
Arthur, yes, your opinion. Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1230
02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:22.850
-绝对不是"A"  -好吧
-Definitely not "A."  -Okay.

1231
02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:26.140
或是…"B"
Or... "B"?

1232
02:26:27.770 --> 02:26:29.020
我再看看选项"Ａ"
Let me see "A" again?

1233
02:26:34.650 --> 02:26:37.780
好了  该换装了
Right. We should get dressed.

1234
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:41.870
我一直都穿着
I'm always dressed.

1235
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:10.020
识别证
ID?

1236
02:27:10.270 --> 02:27:11.440
识别证
ID.

1237
02:27:14.610 --> 02:27:15.730
遵命
Aye, aye.

1238
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:19.280
"遵命"
"Aye, aye"?

1239
02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:23.370
星辰实验室人事档案

1240
02:27:35.330 --> 02:27:36.960
卫斯理·罗伊
宪兵  允许通行

1241
02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:43.850
可以了
Okay.

1242
02:27:44.010 --> 02:27:46.100
"可以"  可以了
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1243
02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:54.150
博士
Doc!

1244
02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:55.520
他们放你出来了
They let you out of quarantine.

1245
02:27:55.690 --> 02:27:56.980
是啊  他们终于肯听我讲道理
Yeah, I finally got them to listen to reason.

1246
02:27:57.150 --> 02:27:59.400
现在让我们看看电子激光
Now, let's take a look and see what progress we've made

1247
02:27:59.570 --> 02:28:00.570
有什么进展
with the electron-laser.

1248
02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:03.070
我们有了真正的进展  让我给你看
We've made some real progress. Let me show you.

1249
02:28:18.170 --> 02:28:20.670
维克多  清空这地方
Victor, clear this place out.

1250
02:28:21.010 --> 02:28:22.260
没问题
Done.

1251
02:28:26.470 --> 02:28:28.600
红色警戒  受到污染
Code Red. Contamination breach.

1252
02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.930
生化威胁

1253
02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:32.560
全体人员立刻疏散
All personnel evacuate immediately.

1254
02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:34.770
生化威胁红色警戒
Bio red five.

1255
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:37.320
感应器侦测到外星微生物
The sensor's picking up a microbe of alien origin.

1256
02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.110
外星微生物不可能
A microbe of alien origin? That doesn't make any sense.

1257
02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.280
一定是虚惊一场
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1258
02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:43.820
各位  关闭实验室  尽快离开
All right, people, shut it down. Let's go.

1259
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:45.030
-刚刚才扫过一遍  -走吧
-Ryan, we just had it swept.  -We have to go, Doc.

1260
02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:47.370
-一定有人误触警报  -走吧  博士
Think about it. It's gotta be a false alarm.  -Let's go, Doc.

1261
02:28:47.530 --> 02:28:49.120
-想想看  -全员撤离
-Think about it. Full base evacuation! Everyone out!

1262
02:28:49.290 --> 02:28:51.540
听好  等等  该死
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1263
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:54.460
保持冷静  前往最近出口
Remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit.

1264
02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:02.630
注意  全体人员
Attention, all personnel.

1265
02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:05.590
快点  大家都出去  快点
Go! Go! Everybody out! Come on! Move!

1266
02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:07.390
快走  快啊
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1267
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:09.060
大家都出去  快点
Everybody out! Go!

1268
02:29:27.450 --> 02:29:29.420
生化威胁

1269
02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:29.990
安全

1270
02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:31.080
搞定
Yes!

1271
02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:32.080
搞定了
Gotcha!

1272
02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:35.120
这是塞拉斯·斯通博士  收到吗
Post Commander, this is Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1273
02:29:35.290 --> 02:29:37.750
-请说  -这是假警报
-Go ahead, Dr. Stone.  -This is a false alarm.

1274
02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:41.090
有人骇入系统  我们得…
Someone has hacked into the system. We must alert...

1275
02:29:50.430 --> 02:29:51.850
维克多
Victor.

1276
02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:55.770
斯通博士  你在吗  我没收到
Dr. Stone, you there? I don't copy.

1277
02:29:56.810 --> 02:29:57.810
我搞错了
I was mistaken.

1278
02:29:57.980 --> 02:29:59.190
警报是真的
The alarm's legit.

1279
02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:00.940
大家都出去  任何人  我重复
Everybody out. And nobody, I repeat,

1280
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:03.860
没有我的允许  任何人都不准回来
nobody comes back inside without my say-so.

1281
02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:05.280
收到了
Roger that, sir.

1282
02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:16.960
大家都出来
Get the civilians out!

1283
02:30:17.290 --> 02:30:18.290
快点  快点
Let's go! Let's go!

1284
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:24.090
-大家都安全出来了  -应该吧
-Everybody got out okay?  -I think so.

1285
02:30:24.260 --> 02:30:25.090
-每一个人  -对
-Everybody?  -Yes.

1286
02:30:58.420 --> 02:30:59.670
这里
This way.

1287
02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:12.220
它知道他来了
It knows he's here.

1288
02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:15.390
超紧张的
Ooh, that's intense.

1289
02:31:19.850 --> 02:31:21.730
太惊人了
This is amazing.

1290
02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:23.770
太疯狂了
This is crazy.

1291
02:31:23.940 --> 02:31:25.820
什么  现在才说疯狂
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1292
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:28.360
你们这群疯子最好知道自己在干嘛
You two lunatics better know what you're doing.

1293
02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:39.730
露易丝·莱恩
星球日报记者

1294
02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:47.520
验孕棒

1295
02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:56.180
系统即将上线
Systems coming online.

1296
02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:03.350
欢迎  维克多  您想接手掌控吗
Welcome, Victor. Would you like to assume command?

1297
02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:04.350
我进去了
I'm in.

1298
02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:15.990
这艘飞船说母盒有敌意
The ship says the Mother Box is hostile.

1299
02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:17.820
我可以取消安全协定
I can override the security protocols,

1300
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:19.620
但是没时间修复卢瑟对主电容器
but there's no time to repair all the electrical damage

1301
02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:22.080
造成的所有的电力损害
that Luthor's power surges caused to the primary capacitors.

1302
02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:23.410
说白话
English.

1303
02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:25.620
电流不够  无法唤醒母盒
There's not enough charge to wake the box.

1304
02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:28.000
我可能有办法
I might be able to do it.

1305
02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:32.250
我也许可以启动它
I mean, I might be able to jump-start it.

1306
02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:33.460
我不喜欢打破这规则
I don't like to break this rule,

1307
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:35.550
但是当我接近光速  我…
but when I approach the speed of light, I...

1308
02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:37.220
听着  时间会发生疯狂的事
Look, crazy things happen to time,

1309
02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:39.970
但要是我成功了  就能制造巨大的电力
but if I do it, I create massive electrical power.

1310
02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:41.890
我可以往回跑  只要距离够远
I could backtrack, if I can get enough distance,

1311
02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:44.220
就能传导大量电流
I can conduct a significant electrical current.

1312
02:34:44.390 --> 02:34:46.730
也许可以唤醒母盒  如果…
I might be able to wake the box, if that's...

1313
02:34:47.140 --> 02:34:48.730
还是要这么做的话
still what we want?

1314
02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:50.310
没错  开始吧
It is. Do it.

1315
02:34:55.150 --> 02:34:56.360
你好  莱恩小姐
Hey, Miss Lane.

1316
02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:57.360
早安
Morning.

1317
02:34:57.530 --> 02:34:58.780
我以为你不会来了
I didn't think you were coming.

1318
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:01.410
最后一次
One last time.

1319
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:05.540
封锁线    请勿跨越

1320
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:21.930
我看到发动机  这一定是终点线
I see engines, so this must be the end of the line. So I'm...

1321
02:35:22.430 --> 02:35:23.510
我就位了
I'm in position.

1322
02:35:26.390 --> 02:35:28.480
准备开始投放程序
Ready to initiate drop sequence.

1323
02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:30.560
母盒准备好了
The Mother Box is ready.

1324
02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:51.920
这艘飞船在求我不要唤醒母盒
The ship's begging me not to wake the box.

1325
02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:53.880
-这是无法逆转的程序  -它很害怕
This action is irreversible. It's afraid.

1326
02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:55.130
它知道荒原狼会来找它
It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.

1327
02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:57.050
我们知道了  继续吧
We know that already. Continue.

1328
02:35:57.380 --> 02:35:59.840
我强烈建议不要启动
I strongly advise against activation.

1329
02:36:00.010 --> 02:36:01.550
巴里  我要开始倒数了
Barry, I'm initiating the countdown.

1330
02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:03.430
这是无法逆转的程序
This action is irreversible.

1331
02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:04.640
-五  -五
-Five...  -Five...

1332
02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:05.560
五
-Five...

1333
02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:06.850
-天启星有敌意  -馊主意
-Apokoliptian technology is hostile.  -This is a bad idea.

1334
02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:07.980
并不是  继续吧
No, it isn't. Keep going.

1335
02:36:08.270 --> 02:36:09.100
四
Four...

1336
02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:10.440
-四  -四
-Four...  -Four...

1337
02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:12.310
-我强烈建议不要启动  -我们得立刻中止
I strongly advise against activation.  -We need to abort, now.

1338
02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:13.440
快动手
-Just do it.

1339
02:36:13.770 --> 02:36:14.770
-三  -三
-Three...  -Three...

1340

02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:17.940
-二  -二
-Two...  -Two...

1342
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:19.860
-二  -这是无法逆转的程序
-Two...  -This course is irreversible.

1343
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:21.110
-一  -一
-One.  -One.

1344
02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:24.950
-一  -这是无法逆转的程序
One. This action is irreversible.

1345
02:37:45.370 --> 02:37:49.330
正义联盟

1346
02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:55.460
-维克多  -不
-Victor?  -No.

1347
02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:57.330
上
Go?

1348
02:39:28.050 --> 02:39:31.100
未来已经在现在扎根
The future has taken root in the present.

1349
02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:32.680
快趴下
-Get down!

1350
02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:53.800
你若在寻找他的纪念碑  看看你周围

1351
02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:18.330
他活过来了
He's back.

1352
02:41:45.350 --> 02:41:48.070
不太对劲  他在扫描我们
Something's wrong. He's scanning us.

1353
02:41:50.190 --> 02:41:51.610
什么
What?

1354
02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:07.630
维克多
Victor?

1355
02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:09.920
维克多
Victor?

1356
02:42:12.210 --> 02:42:13.760
-该死  -你在干嘛
-Shit.  -What are you doing?

1357
02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:15.760
是我的自动防御系统
It's my auto-defense system.

1358
02:42:15.930 --> 02:42:16.970
它感应到危险
It senses danger.

1359
02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:18.300
维克多  住手
Victor, no! Victor!

1360
02:42:18.470 --> 02:42:20.310
-我无法控制  -住手
-I can't control it.  -Don't!

1361
02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:33.900
卡尔·艾尔  不要
Kal-El, no!

1362
02:42:42.290 --> 02:42:44.250
他头脑不清楚  不知道自己是谁
He's confused. He doesn't know who he is.

1363
02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:54.050
亚瑟  我们得制伏他
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

1364
02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:28.250
卡尔·艾尔  最后的氪星之子
Kal-El, the last Son of Krypton...

1365
02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:31.540
回想你是谁
remember who you are.

1366
02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:34.590
告诉我你是谁
Tell me who you...

1367
02:45:09.390 --> 02:45:10.230
快逃
Let's go!

1368
02:45:19.650 --> 02:45:21.280
你最好闪边
You should probably move.

1369
02:45:24.570 --> 02:45:25.570
-没事吗  -没事
-You all right?  -Yeah.

1370
02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:28.200
起来  去找掩护  快去
Get up. Take cover back there. Go.

1371
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:22.670
别逼我这么做
Please don't make me do this.

1372
02:46:55.370 --> 02:46:56.500
克拉克
Clark.

1373
02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:58.750
克拉克  不
Clark, no.

1374
02:47:10.350 --> 02:47:11.310
克拉克
Clark.

1375
02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:12.890
不
No.

1376

这世界需要你
This world needs you.

1377
02:47:20.770 --> 02:47:21.690
克拉克
Clark.

1378
02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:23.320
克拉克
Clark.

1379
02:47:23.650 --> 02:47:25.440
别开枪
Whoa! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1380
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:28.160
克拉克
Clark.

1381
02:47:31.530 --> 02:47:32.910
求求你
Please.

1382

求求你
Please.

1383
02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:20.670
求求你
Please.

1384
02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:23.210
走吧
Just go.

1385
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:24.670
没错
Yeah.

1386
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:26.840
我们走吧
Let's go.

1387
02:48:59.410 --> 02:49:01.750
真是拍谢
I'm so sorry.

1388
02:49:10.970 --> 02:49:11.880
找掩护
Take cover!

1389
02:49:12.050 --> 02:49:14.550
-他来了  -母盒
-He's coming.  -The Mother Box.

1390
02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:15.760
它在哪里
Where is it?

1391
02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:27.690
快点
Come on.

1392
02:49:28.610 --> 02:49:29.900
快点
Come on.

1393
02:49:55.430 --> 02:49:58.470
注意  实验室受到入侵
Attention, security breach detected.

1394
02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:01.230
第四区  第三层
Sector Four, Level Three.

1395
02:50:01.390 --> 02:50:04.190
立刻执行封锁程序
Implement lockdown procedures immediately.

1396
02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:34.340
把母盒给我
Give me the Mother Box.

1397
02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:48.940
不  不
No, no, no.

1398
02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:53.190
爸  等等  不要
Dad, wait! Don't!

1399
02:51:33.530 --> 02:51:36.400
末日即将开始
So begins the end.

1400
02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:43.450
维克多
Victor?

1401
02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:49.120
维克多  你没事吧  站起来
Vic... Whoa, Victor. Are you okay, man? Come on.

1402
02:51:55.130 --> 02:51:56.300
维克多
Victor?

1403
02:51:57.420 --> 02:51:58.880
他死了
He's dead.

1404
02:51:59.050 --> 02:52:00.050
什么
What?

1405
02:52:01.140 --> 02:52:02.350
我父亲
My father.

1406
02:52:03.810 --> 02:52:06.770
我没能救他  我没办法
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1407
02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:08.850
天啊
Oh, my God.

1408
02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:17.860
他父亲是因我们而死
His father's dead 'cause of us.

1409
02:52:18.030 --> 02:52:19.490
我就说唤醒母盒是个馊主意
I told you waking that box was a bad idea.

1410
02:52:19.660 --> 02:52:21.240
这不是个馊主意
It wasn't a bad idea.

1411
02:52:21.410 --> 02:52:23.740
我们需要超人  现在仍然需要
We needed Superman. We still do.

1412
02:52:23.910 --> 02:52:26.200
不管是什么回来了  那不是超人
Well, whatever returned, it isn't Superman.

1413
02:52:26.370 --> 02:52:29.370
也许是他的躯体和超能力  但那不是他
His body and powers, maybe. But it ain't him.

1414
02:52:29.540 --> 02:52:31.170
那是他
It is him.

1415
02:52:31.330 --> 02:52:33.460
他认得露易丝·莱恩
He recognized Lois Lane.

1416
02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:35.750
-谁  -他挚爱的女人
-Who?  -The woman he loves.

1417
02:52:36.130 --> 02:52:38.130
-他记得她  -才怪
-He remembers her.  -Nah.

1418
02:52:38.670 --> 02:52:40.430
他会去找她是因为她不怕他
He went to her 'cause she wasn't afraid of him.

1419
02:52:40.590 --> 02:52:42.010
这叫做直觉  戴安娜
It's called instinct, Diana.

1420
02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:51.270
等等  荒原狼去了哪儿
Wait, where did Steppenwolf go?

1421
02:52:51.440 --> 02:52:54.770
他回去基地组装三个母盒
He's gone back to his base to assemble the three boxes.

1422
02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:57.030
我们不知道他的基地在哪里  或是还要多久…
And we don't know where his base is.  -Or how long until...

1423
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:58.030
几个小时
-Hours.

1424
02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:59.860
盒子一旦同步  形成三位一体
The boxes synchronize, Unity forms,

1425
02:53:00.030 --> 02:53:02.280
我们不能及时阻止他  地球就完了
we don't get there in time to stop it, the planet dies.

1426
02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:04.870
这不像你
This is not your...

1427
02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:08.910
他早就知道
He knew.

1428
02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:10.790
他早就知道了
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1429
02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:12.370
他不是想要摧毁那个母盒
He wasn't trying to destroy the box...

1430
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:14.710
而是想要让它过热
he was trying to superheat it.

1431
02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:17.550
让核心变成核反应炉以外  地球上最热的东西
He made the core the hottest thing on Earth outside of a nuclear reactor.

1432
02:53:17.710 --> 02:53:19.760
-那么热的东西一定会…  -热源影像系统
Now, anything that hot would have to...Blink off the charts

1433
02:53:19.920 --> 02:53:22.130
一定会破表
on a thermal imaging system.

1434
02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:25.680
你父亲为了标记母盒牺牲自己
Your father sacrificed himself to mark that box.

1435
02:53:25.850 --> 02:53:27.720
我们得回我的实验室使用卫星
We have to get back to my lab and use the satellite

1436
02:53:27.890 --> 02:53:29.890
扫描地球哪里有热异常
to scan the Earth for thermal anomalies.

1437
02:53:30.060 --> 02:53:31.190
我已经在扫描了
I'm already on it.

1438
02:53:31.350 --> 02:53:33.350
什么  你有一颗卫星
I'm sorry. You have a satellite?

1439
02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:34.480
我有六颗
I have six.

1440
02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:36.070
是喔
Right.

1441
02:53:37.860 --> 02:53:39.860
咱们去找那个混帐东西
Let's go find the son of a bitch.

1442
02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:50.950
第六章

1443
02:53:47.400 --> 02:53:50.950
“更黑暗的东西”

1444
02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:04.260
法拍屋出售

1445
02:54:04.430 --> 02:54:06.510
你把我带来这里
You brought us here.

1446
02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:07.850
你记得
You remembered.

1447
02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:10.390
这是我的家
This is home.

1448
02:54:12.310 --> 02:54:13.520
你说话了
You spoke.

1449
02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:19.440
我之前没有吗
Did I not before?

1450
02:54:53.430 --> 02:54:55.980
你母亲迟缴了房贷
Your mother got behind on the payments.

1451
02:54:57.480 --> 02:54:59.480
没有告诉任何人
She never told anyone.

1452
02:55:01.150 --> 02:55:02.900
我不明白
I don't understand.

1453
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:08.410
她的自尊心很强  克拉克
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1454
02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:12.910
穿上去
Here.

1455
02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:29.510
她很喜欢这里
She loved it here.

1456
02:55:40.310 --> 02:55:41.940
我也是
So did I.

1457
02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:45.360
我也是
So did I.

1458
02:56:12.470 --> 02:56:14.100
这太酷了
This is awesome.

1459
02:56:14.260 --> 02:56:15.770
我带了一些朋友来
Brought some friends.

1460
02:56:22.310 --> 02:56:24.900
天啊  太棒了
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1461
02:56:25.070 --> 02:56:27.570
大伙儿  这是阿尔弗雷德  我替他工作
Everyone, this is Alfred. I work for him.

1462
02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:29.950
-阿尔弗雷德  -你好  女士
-Alfred.  -Good day, ma'am.

1463
02:56:36.410 --> 02:56:38.290
这里真的很酷  阿尔弗雷德
It's badass, Alfred.

1464
02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:43.500
我去泡茶
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1465
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:44.670
太好了
Great.

1466
02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:46.670
不知道哪里有这么多杯子
I don't know where we're gonna find the cups.

1467
02:56:49.590 --> 02:56:52.430
那就是母盒  就在那里
There's the Mother Box, right there.

1468
02:56:52.590 --> 02:56:54.390
显示可见光谱
Go to visible spectrum.

1469
02:56:57.270 --> 02:56:58.100
普扎诺夫
Pozharnov.

1470
02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:01.520
离莫斯科不远的鬼城
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

1471
02:57:01.690 --> 02:57:04.360
三十年前发生核事故后被废弃
It's been abandoned since the nuclear accident there 30 years ago.

1472
02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:05.730
就连军队也不进去
Not even the army goes in.

1473
02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:07.190
是啊  辐射性一定强到
Right, it's probably so radioactive

1474
02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:09.530
你的脖子会长出另一只脚
that you grow an extra foot outta your neck.

1475
02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:10.530
不再是这样了
Not anymore.

1476
02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:12.870
他收集了辐射  用来创建他的基地
He's harvested the radiation to build his base.

1477
02:57:13.030 --> 02:57:13.870
放大
Zoom.

1478
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:19.250
他到底在盖什么
What the hell is he building?

1479
02:57:19.410 --> 02:57:20.660
三位一体在里面
The Unity's in there.

1480
02:57:20.830 --> 02:57:22.250
我们要从上面进攻
We'll attack from above.

1481
02:57:22.420 --> 02:57:25.000
炸药无法分开母盒
Explosives won't separate the boxes,

1482
02:57:25.170 --> 02:57:27.000
只会强化它们的联系
only strengthen their bond.

1483
02:57:27.170 --> 02:57:28.300
什么  我们不能炸掉它
What? So we can't blow it up?

1484
02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:29.920
不能从外面
Not from the outside.

1485
02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:33.890
我想插入合而为一的母盒
I want to plug into The Unity, one-on-one.

1486
02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:36.010
和它融为一体
Fuse with it.

1487
02:57:36.180 --> 02:57:38.720
从内部削弱它的连结  就能够再把它拆成三个
Weaken its bond from the inside so we can break it back into three.

1488
02:57:38.890 --> 02:57:41.100
不行  你不知道你会面对什么
No, you don't know what you'd be up against.

1489
02:57:41.270 --> 02:57:44.810
你得一个人融入三位一体
You'd have to stream into The Unity by yourself.

1490
02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:47.320
这三个母盒结合起来足以毁天灭地
These boxes together are world destroyers.

1491
02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:48.900
它们存在了十亿年
A billion years old.

1492
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:51.200
绝对会钻进你脑袋  找到你的弱点
They'll get inside you and find your weaknesses

1493
02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:53.530
和你的恐惧  并用来摧毁你
and your fears, and use them to destroy you.

1494
02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:55.700
只要让我进去  替我争取时间
Just get me in and get me time.

1495
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:57.120
你可能会死  维克多
You could die, Victor.

1496
02:57:57.280 --> 02:57:59.580
我不这样做  我们都会死
If I don't, we all die. Period.

1497
02:58:04.330 --> 02:58:06.090
我失去了一切
I got nothing left.

1498
02:58:11.470 --> 02:58:13.430
你不是要我使用这些超能力吗
You wanted me to use these gifts, right?

1499
02:58:16.510 --> 02:58:18.010
我就要这么做
That's what I'm gonna do.

1500
02:58:18.180 --> 02:58:20.060
好吧  所以…
Okay. So...

1501
02:58:20.770 --> 02:58:24.020
维克多想和末日母盒  合而为一拯救世界
if Victor wants to try to save the world by fusing with the doom boxes,

1502
02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:26.400
那就让他这么做吧
I say we put him in the doom boxes.

1503
02:58:26.730 --> 02:58:29.530
但要让他这么做就得攻击基地
But getting him in means attacking that base.

1504
02:58:29.690 --> 02:58:31.900
深入地狱向魔鬼与他的军团…
Fighting the devil and his army

1505
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:33.110
正式开战
in hell.

1506
02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:35.530
这家伙在他摧毁的星球上
I mean, this guy's probably fought

1507
02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:39.660
大概打过成千上万个超级英雄  对吧
hundreds of thousands of other superbeings on the other planets he's destroyed, right?

1508
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:41.330
我们得假设他都赢了
And we have to assume he's won.

1509
02:58:41.500 --> 02:58:44.620
我才不管他在多少个地狱  打过多少恶魔
I don't care how many demons he's fought in how many hells...

1510
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:48.290
他没打过我们  团结一致的我们
he's never fought us. Not us united.

1511
02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:40.390
我猜你说"愿意"
Take that as a "yes."

1512
02:59:41.010 --> 02:59:41.850
什么
What?

1513
02:59:45.310 --> 02:59:46.560
那只婚戒
The ring.

1514
02:59:50.270 --> 02:59:51.820
你真的回来了
You're really back.

1515
03:00:25.310 --> 03:00:27.520
我得到第二次机会
I have a second chance, Lo.

1516
03:00:29.810 --> 03:00:32.270
绝对不会白白浪费
And I am not gonna waste it.

1517
03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:31.710
真的是你吗
Are you really you?

1518
03:01:31.870 --> 03:01:33.580
真的是我  妈
I'm really me, Ma.

1519
03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:53.650
听好  妈
Listen, Ma.

1520
03:01:55.230 --> 03:01:57.270
他们让我回来一定有原因
They wanted me back for a reason.

1521
03:01:59.030 --> 03:02:00.570
我得知道为什么
I need to find out why.

1522
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:22.130
维克多怎么样
How's Victor doing?

1523
03:02:26.510 --> 03:02:29.260
你也知道  他想独处一下
You know, wanted to be by himself.

1524
03:02:30.850 --> 03:02:34.020
我们要求一个刚失去父亲的孩子…
We're asking a kid who just lost his father

1525
03:02:34.190 --> 03:02:36.980
对抗全宇宙最强大的机器
to go up against the most powerful machines in the universe.

1526
03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:40.320
这不公平
It's not fair.

1527
03:02:42.070 --> 03:02:43.700
我以为你不在乎
I thought you didn't care?

1528
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:46.620
我从来没这么说过
I never said that.

1529
03:02:59.550 --> 03:03:00.960
怎么了
What is it?

1530
03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:09.890
我做过一个梦  不晓得  几乎就像一种预感
I had a dream, like, I don't know, almost like a premonition.

1531
03:03:10.850 --> 03:03:13.640
那是世界末日
It was the end of the world

1532
03:03:13.810 --> 03:03:16.650
巴里·艾伦就在这里
and Barry Allen was right here

1533
03:03:16.810 --> 03:03:20.690
他跟我说  "露易丝·莱恩才是关键"
and he said to me, "Lois Lane is the key."

1534
03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:26.570
对超人来说…她是
She is... to Superman.

1535
03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:29.240
每个人都有心爱的人
Every heart has one.

1536
03:03:29.870 --> 03:03:31.740
我想不只是这样
I think it's something more.

1537
03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:34.500
这是更黑暗的东西
Something darker.

1538
03:03:38.670 --> 03:03:39.670
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne.

1539
03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:41.340
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne!

1540
03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:43.840
你得来看看
You need to see this.

1541
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:08.820
你修好了
You fixed it.

1542
03:04:08.990 --> 03:04:10.700
它想要飞行
It wanted to fly.

1543
03:04:11.950 --> 03:04:13.290
飞行是它的本能
Flight is its nature.

1544
03:04:13.450 --> 03:04:14.750
也是你的
Yours, too.

1545
03:04:21.540 --> 03:04:23.500
他会来的  阿尔弗雷德  我知道
He'll be here, Alfred, I know it.

1546
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:25.300
你为何这么肯定
What makes you so sure?

1547
03:04:26.050 --> 03:04:28.630
信念  阿尔弗雷德  信念
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1548
03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:52.320
终于
At last.

1549
03:04:54.160 --> 03:04:56.870
准备迎接他的到来
Prepare for his arrival.

1550
03:04:58.710 --> 03:05:02.840
我即将得到救赎
My redemption is nigh.

1551
03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:12.180
合而为一
Unite.

1552
03:05:17.350 --> 03:05:19.850
同步化
Synchronize.

1553
03:06:04.190 --> 03:06:07.110
卫星显示他打造了一个防御圆顶
The satellites revealed he's created a defensive dome.

1554
03:06:07.270 --> 03:06:08.440
这是个设计缺陷
It's a design flaw.

1555
03:06:08.610 --> 03:06:10.860
把塔台射倒  圆顶就会崩垮
Take out the tower, the dome will fall.

1556
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:13.030
敌人不会料到我们正面攻击
The enemy never anticipated a frontal assault.

1557
03:06:13.200 --> 03:06:16.700
是啊  因为他没想到  有人会这么疯狂
Right, probably 'cause he didn't think anyone would be that nuts.

1558
03:06:17.700 --> 03:06:18.990
布鲁斯是对的
Bruce is right.

1559
03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:20.750
我们必须摧毁防御圆顶
We've got to destroy the defensive dome

1560
03:06:20.910 --> 03:06:23.210
在它们同步化之前找到母盒
so we can reach The Unity before it synchronizes.

1561
03:06:23.370 --> 03:06:25.080
要是圆顶没被摧毁呢
What if the dome's not destroyed?

1562
03:06:25.250 --> 03:06:26.250
它一定会被摧毁
It'll be destroyed.

1563
03:06:26.420 --> 03:06:28.050
维克多一旦融入三位一体
Once Victor is linked with The Unity

1564
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:31.800
有巴里的协助  他就能突破母盒的防御
with Barry's help, he'll break through The Unity's defenses.

1565
03:06:31.970 --> 03:06:33.430
提醒我  我该怎么做
Remind me, how's that again?

1566
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:35.220
用爱的力量
Uh, with the power of love.

1567
03:06:35.390 --> 03:06:38.010
-巴里  -我得造成能量大爆发
-Barry.  -With a catastrophic energy surge.

1568
03:06:38.180 --> 03:06:39.180
很好
Good.

1569
03:06:39.350 --> 03:06:41.230
你得比以前跑得更快
You'll have to run faster than you've ever attempted

1570
03:06:41.390 --> 03:06:43.940
才能产生这么大的电流
to generate a charge of that size.

1571
03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:46.110
然后直接碰触维克多的身体
And then you make physical contact with Victor.

1572
03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:49.320
那股能量应该能让他进入母盒
That force should propel him inside The Unity.

1573
03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:51.360
维克多  之后就靠你了
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

1574
03:06:51.530 --> 03:06:54.280
在它同步化之前把它扯开
Take it apart from the inside before it synchronizes.

1575
03:06:55.860 --> 03:06:57.990
我们终于有了计划
Whew. We actually finally have a plan.

1576
03:06:58.530 --> 03:07:00.240
我们有了计划
We have a plan.

1577
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:17.640
艾尔之家的标记代表希望
The symbol of the house of El means hope.

1578
03:07:17.800 --> 03:07:19.970
这希望包含了一个基本的信念
Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief

1579
03:07:20.140 --> 03:07:23.850
那就是每个人都有行善的潜力
in the potential of every person to be a force for good.

1580
03:07:24.020 --> 03:07:24.850
克拉克
Clark...

1581
03:07:25.020 --> 03:07:26.310
那就是你能带给他们的
That's what you can bring them.

1582
03:07:26.480 --> 03:07:28.440
你被送来这里是有原因的
...you were sent here for a reason.

1583
03:07:28.610 --> 03:07:32.480
你将给地球的人类  一个努力达到的理想
You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards.

1584
03:07:33.150 --> 03:07:34.990
就算你必须穷尽一生
And even if it takes you the rest of your life,

1585
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:38.910
也得尽全力找到你来这里的原因
you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is.

1586
03:07:39.070 --> 03:07:41.700
他们会犯错  也会失败
They will stumble, they will fall.

1587
03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:43.200
但你必须做出选择
You're gonna have to make a choice.

1588
03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.420
他们将与你一起迎向阳光
They will join you in the sun, Kal.

1589
03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:50.540
你必须选择是否要  骄傲地站在全人类面前
A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not.

1590
03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:53.880
你将帮助他们完成奇迹
You will help them accomplish wonders.

1591
03:08:11.020 --> 03:08:15.530
氪星所有的希望和梦想  都寄托在你身上
All the hopes and dreams of Krypton live in you now.

1592
03:08:15.690 --> 03:08:17.950
我真为你感到骄傲  儿子
I'm so proud of you, son.

1593
03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:21.330
你母亲和我都很爱你
Your mother and I loved you.

1594
03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:25.540
你母亲和我都知道你会改变世界
Your mother and I knew you would change the world.

1595
03:08:26.830 --> 03:08:28.670
你的心受到考验
Your heart was tested.

1596
03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:31.920
我知道这很难  克拉克
I know it's been hard, Clark.

1597
03:08:32.670 --> 03:08:35.590
但你给了他们的世界一个希望
But you gave hope to their world.

1598
03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:38.430
你必须让他们看到你是谁
You need to show them who you are.

1599
03:08:39.130 --> 03:08:40.840
爱他们吧  卡尔·艾尔
Love them, Kal.

1600
03:08:41.470 --> 03:08:43.600
就像我们爱你一样
The way we loved you.

1601
03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:47.180
飞吧  儿子
Fly, son.

1602
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:49.440
是时候了
It's time.

1603
03:09:53.210 --> 03:09:56.340
我要把塔台射倒  破坏力场圆顶
I'm gonna take out that tower and knock down that shield dome.

1604
03:09:56.500 --> 03:09:57.630
不管你们看到什么
Whatever you see,

1605
03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:00.920
都要按照计划
stick to the plan.

1606
03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:04.720
这就是我把你们聚在一起的原因
It's why I brought you together.

1607
03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:46.550
布鲁斯  撤退  你不会成功的
Bruce, pull back. You're not gonna make it.

1608
03:10:50.350 --> 03:10:52.390
只要敲大声一点
Just have to knock a little louder.

1609
03:11:17.380 --> 03:11:18.960
杀了他
Kill him!

1610
03:11:19.130 --> 03:11:21.880
快去捍卫三位一体
Get to the carriage. Defend The Unity.

1611
03:11:27.180 --> 03:11:28.100
惨了
Oh, shit.

1612
03:11:48.410 --> 03:11:49.330
塔台倒了
The tower's down.

1613
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:52.370
收到吗
Do you read me?

1614
03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:54.120
收到了
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1615
03:11:55.210 --> 03:11:56.580
你没事吗
Are you okay?

1616
03:11:57.830 --> 03:12:00.420
布鲁斯
Bruce? Bruce?

1617
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:01.590
快去反应炉
Get to the reactor.

1618
03:12:01.750 --> 03:12:04.260
我会尽量把这些怪物引开来
I'll lure as many of these monsters away from you as I can.

1619
03:12:04.420 --> 03:12:05.260
那是什么意思
-What does that mean?

1620
03:12:08.260 --> 03:12:10.260
别担心我  快去找到母盒
Don't worry about me. Get to The Unity.

1621
03:12:12.930 --> 03:12:14.100
它们来了
They're here.

1622
03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:15.390
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1623
03:12:18.310 --> 03:12:19.610
失去讯号
Comm went dead.

1624
03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:22.570
上吧
Let's go.

1625
03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:03.320
跟我来呀  你们这群臭虫
Come on, follow me, you damn insects.

1626
03:14:23.270 --> 03:14:24.440
严重受损
Critical damage.

1627
03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:05.690
你真的发疯了
You really are outta your mind.

1628
03:15:32.590 --> 03:15:33.720
不客气
You're welcome.

1629
03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:35.180
厉害  兄弟
My man.

1630
03:17:08.270 --> 03:17:09.900
放心  我们能搞定
Yeah, we got this.

1631
03:17:10.060 --> 03:17:11.440
你去做该做的事
You go do your thing.

1632
03:18:07.240 --> 03:18:08.750
我猜你就是阿尔弗雷德
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1633
03:18:10.620 --> 03:18:11.920
肯特少爷
Master Kent.

1634
03:18:13.960 --> 03:18:15.460
他说你会来
He said you'd come.

1635
03:18:17.170 --> 03:18:20.590
希望你没有来得太晚
Now, let's hope you're not too late.

1636
03:18:31.440 --> 03:18:32.520
喂
-Hey!

1637
03:18:41.820 --> 03:18:43.160
记得我吗
Remember me?

1638
03:18:45.700 --> 03:18:47.120
第二回合
Round two?

1639
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:48.990
好啊
Hell yeah.

1640
03:19:10.520 --> 03:19:11.890
上吧
Shall we?

1641
03:19:12.850 --> 03:19:15.150
告诉我  亚马逊女战士
Tell me, Amazon,

1642
03:19:15.310 --> 03:19:18.610
你为何抛弃自己的姐妹
why did you abandon your own sisters

1643
03:19:19.530 --> 03:19:21.940
跑来跟这些卑微的生物
only to cast your lot with these creatures

1644
03:19:22.110 --> 03:19:25.410
混在一起
clinging to their puny lives?

1645
03:19:25.610 --> 03:19:28.450
你没能赶去保护她们被我屠杀
You weren't there to protect them from me.

1646
03:19:28.700 --> 03:19:30.910
可悲的是  你本来可以的
And, sadly, you could have.

1647
03:20:11.700 --> 03:20:13.410
巴里  我就位了
Barry, I'm in position.

1648
03:20:32.180 --> 03:20:34.890
好  我来产生电流
Okay. I built the charge.

1649
03:20:35.520 --> 03:20:36.600
你来倒数
You call it.

1650
03:20:37.770 --> 03:20:39.020
等我倒数到一
Barry, on one.

1651
03:20:39.690 --> 03:20:41.650
三  二…
Three, two...

1652
03:20:44.820 --> 03:20:46.200
放开我
Get the hell off me!

1653
03:20:46.700 --> 03:20:48.030
维克多
Victor!

1654
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:25.650
维克多
Victor!

1655
03:21:29.490 --> 03:21:31.990
我看着你的小岛燃烧
I watched your island burn,

1656
03:21:32.160 --> 03:21:35.620
你的姐妹哀求我饶她们一命
your sisters begging for their lives.

1657
03:21:35.790 --> 03:21:38.040
你母亲也一样
As did your mother.

1658
03:21:38.410 --> 03:21:39.420
骗子
Liar.

1659
03:22:05.150 --> 03:22:07.150
我撑不住了
I can't maintain this!

1660
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:09.030
维克多
Victor!

1661
03:22:31.260 --> 03:22:33.470
维克多  我撑不住了
Victor, I can't hold this!

1662
03:22:40.140 --> 03:22:42.390
为了达克赛德
For Darkseid.

1663
03:22:46.360 --> 03:22:48.730
没什么用
Not impressed.

1664
03:23:33.240 --> 03:23:34.360
好吧
All right.

1665
03:23:34.530 --> 03:23:36.120
卡尔·艾尔
Kal-El.

1666
03:24:14.650 --> 03:24:16.860
巴里  我连上了母盒
Barry, I'm connected to The Unity.

1667
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:18.990
我需要电流才能进去
I need the charge to get inside.

1668
03:24:41.060 --> 03:24:42.060
巴里
Barry?

1669
03:24:42.970 --> 03:24:44.640
巴里  你没事吧
Barry, are you okay?

1670
03:24:46.270 --> 03:24:47.100
巴里
Barry!

1671
03:24:47.270 --> 03:24:50.860
我没力了  我得喘口气
I got the wind knocked out of me. Need a few seconds, that's all!

1672
03:25:07.960 --> 03:25:10.790
巴里  你在哪里  它快要同步化了
Barry, where are you? It's almost synchronized!

1673
03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:12.800
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

1674
03:25:13.630 --> 03:25:15.800
喔买尬  快点愈合  巴里
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

1675
03:25:15.970 --> 03:25:17.630
愈合啊
Heal. Heal.

1676
03:25:43.490 --> 03:25:45.040
巴里

不管发生什么事  我都要你知道
whatever happens, I want you to know

1685
03:27:08.450 --> 03:27:10.450
你儿子也是一个英雄  爸

1686
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:15.580
精英中的精英

创造自己的未来

1688
03:28:20.020 --> 03:28:21.980
也创造自己的过去
Make your own past.

1689
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:30.120
一切都没事了
It's all right now.

1690
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:01.820
斯通  哥谭市立大学

1691
03:29:06.490 --> 03:29:09.070

1692
03:29:17.160 --> 03:29:19.330
我们一直在等着你  维克多
We've been waiting for you, Victor.

1693
03:29:20.460 --> 03:29:22.540
我破碎的儿子
My broken boy.

1694
03:29:24.960 --> 03:29:26.970
你不会再孤单了
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1695
03:29:27.130 --> 03:29:28.800
我们会再全家团圆

1696
03:29:36.640 --> 03:29:38.730
我们可以像以前一样
we can put it back, Vic.

1697
03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:45.190
让你恢复原状
Make you whole again.

1698
03:29:57.040 --> 03:29:58.790
我并没有破碎

荒原狼会失败
Steppenwolf would fail.

1703
03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:09.670
没错  你是说过

1704
03:32:10.340 --> 03:32:14.840
我的主人  母盒被摧毁了
My master, now that the Mother Boxes have been destroyed,

1705
03:32:15.720 --> 03:32:19.470
你要怎么得到你的大奖

1706
03:32:19.720 --> 03:32:23.140
找到了反生命方程序  狄萨德
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1707
03:32:23.310 --> 03:32:27.980
我们会不择手段得到它

1708
03:32:31.150 --> 03:32:32.650
准备出动舰队

1709
03:32:33.570 --> 03:32:35.990
我们要用老方法

1710
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:43.740
后记

1711
03:34:40.160 --> 03:34:43.740
再为人父

1712
03:35:00.340 --> 03:35:02.470
这又是你父亲
Your father twice over.

1713
03:35:09.770 --> 03:35:14.100
现在  让我说出内心话  不是身为一个科学家
Now, let me speak to you from my heart, not as a scientist,

1714
03:35:14.270 --> 03:35:15.940

as a father.

1715
03:35:17.150 --> 03:35:19.190
让我再为人父
Your father twice over.

1716
03:35:21.740 --> 03:35:25.160
我把你带到这世界  又把你带回来
I brought you into the world and back to it.

1717
03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:28.950
你无法想像我有多为你感到骄傲
You can't imagine how proud I am of who you are.

1718
03:35:29.500 --> 03:35:31.160
一直都是如此
Have always been.

1719
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:38.170
我浪费了这么多年没有陪你  也犯了太多错没有改过
So many years with you I wasted. So many wrongs I've left un-righted.

1720
03:35:40.630 --> 03:35:42.510
一切都会崩裂  维克多
Everything breaks, Victor.

1721

一切都会改变
Everything changes.

1722
03:35:56.020 --> 03:35:58.110
我得去见我父亲
I gotta go see my father.

1723
03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:35.520
这世界伤痕累累
The world is hurt.

1724
03:36:35.690 --> 03:36:36.770
支离破碎
Broken.

1725
03:36:36.940 --> 03:36:38.730
无法改变
Unexchangeable.

1726
03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:42.610
飞船是你的了  小子  你是老大
Ship's all yours now, kid. You're the boss.

1727
03:36:44.900 --> 03:36:48.070
"蔡瑞恩  纳米科技总监"

1728

那是你的专长
That's your thing.

1729
03:36:50.410 --> 03:36:51.830
没错
Uh, yep.

1730
03:36:52.410 --> 03:36:54.000
那是我的专长
That's my thing.

1731
03:36:59.040 --> 03:37:04.380
但世界不能在过去修复  只有在未来才能
But the world's not fixed in the past, only the future.

1732
03:37:06.260 --> 03:37:10.140
未来与现在
The not yet. The now.

1733
03:37:10.300 --> 03:37:13.270
至少要有30  45公尺
Wow. Must be 100, 150 feet.

1734
03:37:13.850 --> 03:37:15.180
至少
Must be.

1735
03:37:16.310 --> 03:37:17.940
一张大圆桌
Big round table.

1736
03:37:18.100 --> 03:37:20.270
六张椅子  就在那里

1737
03:37:21.400 --> 03:37:23.030
但还能坐更多人
But room for more.

1738
03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:27.070
还能坐更多人
But room for more.

1739
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:29.820
老天保佑我们
God help us.

1740
03:37:31.620 --> 03:37:33.620
现在就是你
The now is you.

1741
03:37:37.330 --> 03:37:38.710
什么
What?

1742
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:41.670
这是刑事实验室最烂的工作
It's actually the worst job you can get in a crime lab.

1743
03:37:41.840 --> 03:37:44.210
不过我入门了
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1744
03:37:44.380 --> 03:37:45.970
这是"真正"的工作
This is like a "job" job?

1745
03:37:46.760 --> 03:37:47.880
"真正的"
"Job" job.

1746
03:37:52.100 --> 03:37:54.140
你入门了
Your foot's in the door.

1747
03:37:56.480 --> 03:37:57.600
大家不都是这么说吗
Isn't that a thing people say?

1748
03:37:57.770 --> 03:37:59.690
你入门了
Your foot's in the door.

1749
03:37:59.850 --> 03:38:02.150
是啊  大家都是这么说
Yeah, that's something people say, man.

1750
03:38:02.310 --> 03:38:03.730
他入门了
-His foot's in the door!

1751
03:38:04.020 --> 03:38:06.490
-那是我的乖儿子  -噢  天啊
-That's my boy, right there!  -Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1752
03:38:06.690 --> 03:38:08.030
我什么都没教他
Taught him nothing he knows.

1753
03:38:08.200 --> 03:38:10.240
-爸  你会再被喷辣椒水  -好样的
-Yes!  -Dad, you're gonna get maced again.

1754
03:38:13.740 --> 03:38:15.450
你的前途无量
No stopping you now.

1755
03:38:17.580 --> 03:38:18.830
谢了  爸
Thanks, Dad.

1756
03:38:19.210 --> 03:38:20.040
现在
Now.

1757
03:38:20.210 --> 03:38:23.290
现在是你崛起的时刻  维克多
Now's your time, Victor, to rise.

1758
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:26.550
光是说声"谢谢你"并不够
"Thank you" is not enough for what you did.

1759
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:30.090
我只是弥补一个错误而已
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

1760
03:38:40.520 --> 03:38:42.980
你怎么向银行把房子要回来的
How did you get the house back from the bank?

1761
03:38:43.440 --> 03:38:45.440
我买下了银行
I bought the bank.

1762
03:38:47.860 --> 03:38:50.150
对了  恭喜了
Congratulations, by the way.

1763
03:38:50.490 --> 03:38:52.420
坚持下去  勇往直前
Do this. Be this.

1764
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:53.370
挚爱的父亲
塞拉斯·斯通  1969-2017

1765
03:38:52.420 --> 03:38:55.910
当一个我未曾当过的英雄

在勇士之中占有一席之地

1767
03:39:00.210 --> 03:39:05.130
从前  现在与未来

你该挺身而出了
It's time you stand,

03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:41.770
准备好了吗
Ready?

1776
03:40:41.930 --> 03:40:43.230
来吧  史蒂芬
Come on, Stevens.

1777
03:40:46.850 --> 03:40:48.150
继续走吧
All right, let's keep it moving.

1778
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:51.190

Keep going.

1779
03:40:52.990 --> 03:40:54.740
来吧  卢瑟  走吧
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1781
03:41:04.540 --> 03:41:05.540
打开二号牢房  卡尔
Open up two, Carl, please.

1782
03:41:14.720 --> 03:41:16.010
卢瑟
Luthor.

1783
03:41:21.060 --> 03:41:24.270
别闹了  卢瑟  不然我要进去教训你
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor, or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1784
03:41:51.660 --> 03:41:53.880
阿卡汉  哥谭市

1785
03:41:58.950 --> 03:42:01.600
阿卡汉精神病院

1786
03:42:53.520 --> 03:42:54.820
他来了
Ah, there he is.

1787
03:42:55.570 --> 03:42:56.820
欢迎上船
Welcome aboard.

1788
03:42:56.980 --> 03:42:58.780
来一杯顶级香槟
Care for a glass of Gout de Diamants?

1789
03:42:58.940 --> 03:43:00.820
我只是在庆祝神的回归
I was just celebrating God's return.

1790
03:43:00.990 --> 03:43:03.280
从地底回到天空
Out of the ground and back up into the sky.

1791
03:43:03.660 --> 03:43:05.910
听说你脑筋秀逗了
I heard you were a few clowns short of a circus.

1792
03:43:06.580 --> 03:43:07.790
本来是  谢谢你
I was, thank you,

1793
03:43:07.950 --> 03:43:12.250
直到阿卡汉的良医  让我的头脑再度清晰
until the good doctors at Arkham helped me find some much needed clarity.

1794
03:43:12.420 --> 03:43:15.710
你自愿免费干掉蝙蝠侠
Now, you volunteered to destroy the bat free of charge.

1795
03:43:15.880 --> 03:43:17.380
为什么这么好心
Why the pro bono work?

1796
03:43:18.130 --> 03:43:19.210
这是私人恩怨
It's personal.

1797
03:43:19.880 --> 03:43:22.680
让我猜  以眼还眼
Ah, let me guess, an eye for an eye?

1798
03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:26.470
你说你有我要的东西
You said you had something I'd want?

1799
03:43:26.640 --> 03:43:28.060
你最好别浪费我的时间
You'd better not be wasting my time.

1800
03:43:28.470 --> 03:43:32.140
我哪敢惹你呀  威尔森先生
Ooh. And endure your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1801
03:43:32.310 --> 03:43:35.900
我有更重要的事要做  所以得好好活着
No, I wouldn't think of it. Uh, I have too much to live for. And more important things to do.

1802
03:43:36.860 --> 03:43:40.320
但如果你想找到蝙蝠侠
But if you want the Batman,

1803
03:43:40.490 --> 03:43:43.570
有件事可以帮你大忙
here is something that can help you.

1804
03:43:44.910 --> 03:43:49.040
他的名字是布鲁斯·韦恩
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1805
03:43:53.120 --> 03:43:54.670
现在想一想
Hmm. On second thought,

1806
03:43:57.000 --> 03:43:58.920
这件事的确值得庆祝
we do have something to celebrate.

1807
03:44:00.050 --> 03:44:01.470
好样的
Good boy.

1808
03:45:05.780 --> 03:45:06.990
安全
Clear.

1809
03:45:12.490 --> 03:45:14.000
还有多远
How much further?

1810
03:45:15.250 --> 03:45:16.460
就快到了
We're almost there.

1811
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:20.250
我们得快点
Well, we need to hurry.

1812
03:45:20.420 --> 03:45:21.920
不能在外面待太久
We can't be out in the open much longer.

1813
03:45:22.090 --> 03:45:23.710
他会来找我们
He'll come for us.

1814
03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:28.300
让他来
Let him come.

1815
03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:30.430
让那个混蛋来吧
Let the bastard come.

1816
03:45:31.890 --> 03:45:35.680
他杀了亚瑟  我要一刀捅死他
I'll stab this through his heart for what he did to Arthur.

1817
03:45:36.480 --> 03:45:38.400
我要让他付出代价
I want to make him pay.

1818
03:45:40.110 --> 03:45:42.400
我知道你的感受  湄拉
I understand how you feel, Mera.

1819
03:45:42.900 --> 03:45:45.400
你一点都不知道
You have no idea how I feel.

1820
03:45:45.900 --> 03:45:50.030
但我们得按照计划才有机会成功
But we have to stick to the plan to have any chance to make this right.

1821
03:45:57.960 --> 03:46:01.380
你曾经爱过谁
Who have you ever loved?

1822
03:46:15.520 --> 03:46:18.690
你错了  小美人鱼
Au contraire, my little fish stick.

1823
03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:25.860
他很了解失去挚爱的感受
He knows exactly what it's like to lose someone he loves.

1824
03:46:27.820 --> 03:46:30.070
就像是…
You know, like, uh,

1825
03:46:31.410 --> 03:46:32.780
一个父亲
a father,

1826
03:46:34.240 --> 03:46:35.580
和一个母亲
like a mother.

1827
03:46:36.580 --> 03:46:39.620
你说下一句话前最好小心一点
Be very careful with the next thing you say.

1828
03:46:41.290 --> 03:46:43.290
或是一个养子
Like an adopted son.

1829
03:46:47.050 --> 03:46:48.670
对不对…
Isn't that right,

1830
03:46:50.220 --> 03:46:51.680
蝙蝠侠
Batman?

1831
03:46:54.930 --> 03:46:58.140
也许那只臭美人鱼是对的
Maybe, in a way, that smelly old flounder is right.

1832
03:46:59.980 --> 03:47:04.270
你对死亡麻木之前  还有多少人会死在你怀里
Because how many can die in your arms before you grow numb to death?

1833
03:47:05.860 --> 03:47:07.740
你说话一点都不小心
That's not very careful.

1834
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:12.110
你还要看着多少死人的眼睛
And how many dead eyes can you look into

1835
03:47:12.820 --> 03:47:15.200
才会彻底心死
before you die inside yourself?

1836
03:47:15.740 --> 03:47:19.410
我已经心死了很久
I've been dead inside a long time,

1837
03:47:19.580 --> 03:47:21.500
但就连我也有忍耐极限
but even I have a limit.

1838
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:23.380
你敢跨过那极限  我发誓会…
And if you cross that line, I swear to God, I will...

1839
03:47:23.540 --> 03:47:25.840
你会怎样  布鲁斯杀了我
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1840
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:28.340
你不会杀我
You won't kill me.

1841
03:47:29.210 --> 03:47:31.180
我是你最好的麻吉
I'm your best friend.

1842
03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:35.720
而且  谁会摸你的蛋蛋
Besides, who's gonna give you a reach-around?

1843
03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:39.100
反正呢
Anyway,

1844
03:47:40.390 --> 03:47:41.940
你需要我
you need me.

1845
03:47:42.980 --> 03:47:44.480
你…
You

1846
03:47:45.020 --> 03:47:50.650
让她死以后造成的这个世界  需要我帮你恢复原状
need me to help you undo this world you created by letting her die.

1847
03:47:53.240 --> 03:47:54.490
可怜的露易丝
Poor Lois.

1848
03:47:55.280 --> 03:47:58.080
她受尽了折磨
How she suffered so!

1849
03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:05.420
我常常在想
I often wonder

1850
03:48:06.380 --> 03:48:10.510
你在多少个平行时空毁灭世界  老实说…
how many alternate timelines do you destroy the world because...

1851
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:15.840
都是因为你没种让自己死
frankly, you don't have the cojones to die yourself.

1852
03:48:20.430 --> 03:48:24.230
所以我还是一样比你更成熟
So, as usual, I'll be the bigger man.

1853
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:29.530
停战吧
A truce,

1854
03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:31.650
布鲁斯
Bruce.

1855
03:48:34.410 --> 03:48:38.490
只要你有这张牌  我们就停战
As long as you have this card, a truce.

1856
03:48:41.540 --> 03:48:44.750
但你只要把它撕成一半  我就很乐意跟你谈谈
But all you have to do is tear it in half and I'm happy to discuss with you

1857
03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:47.920
你为什么要派那个神奇小子
in any way you like, why you sent the Boy Wonder

1858
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:51.510
去做一个男人的工作
to do a man's job?

1859
03:48:54.930 --> 03:48:56.720
真的很好笑
You know, it's funny

1860
03:48:56.890 --> 03:48:59.930
你竟然敢说有多少人死在我怀里
that you would talk about people who died in my arms

1861
03:49:00.100 --> 03:49:01.810
当我把哈莉·奎茵抱在怀里
because when I held Harley Quinn

1862
03:49:01.970 --> 03:49:04.440
她满身是血  奄奄一息时
and she was bleeding and dying,

1863
03:49:04.600 --> 03:49:08.150
她用最后一口气哀求我
she begged me with her last breath

1864
03:49:08.310 --> 03:49:10.570
当我杀你的时候
that when I killed you,

1865
03:49:10.730 --> 03:49:14.150
别搞错  我一定会他妈的杀了你
and make no mistake, I will fucking kill you...

1866
03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:16.160
她要我慢慢来
that I'd do it slow.

1867
03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:19.330
我会信守这个承诺
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1868
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:52.690
你真会演戏
Oh. You're good.

1869
03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:58.570
差点就唬住我了
You almost had me.

1870
03:50:18.050 --> 03:50:19.130
我们要躲在哪里
Where are we holing up?

1871
03:50:19.300 --> 03:50:21.550
他永远不会料到的地方
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1872
03:50:22.010 --> 03:50:24.930
还是觉得带着他是个好主意吗
Still think it was a good idea bringing him along?

1873
03:50:26.020 --> 03:50:27.560
你觉得呢
-what do you think?

1874
03:50:33.650 --> 03:50:34.650
他找到我们了
He's found us.

1875
03:52:03.820 --> 03:52:05.280
我能帮你吗
Can I help you?

1876
03:52:06.660 --> 03:52:10.160
你一定知道达克赛德不会放过地球
I'm sure you know Darkseid is not finished with Earth.

1877
03:52:10.330 --> 03:52:13.330
反生命方程序就在这里
The Anti-Life Equation is here somewhere.

1878
03:52:13.500 --> 03:52:16.290
我们得赶在他之前找到它
We have to find it before he does.

1879
03:52:16.460 --> 03:52:18.170
决战时刻即将到来
There's a war coming.

1880
03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:20.210
我是来帮忙的
And I'm here to help.

1881
03:52:20.380 --> 03:52:22.630
抱歉  你是哪位
I'm sorry, who are you again?

1882
03:52:22.800 --> 03:52:27.890
我有很多名字和很多形体  就像你一样…
I've gone by many names and taken many forms. And like you,

1883
03:52:28.510 --> 03:52:31.140
我发现自己要对这世界负责
I've realized I have a stake in this world

1884
03:52:31.310 --> 03:52:33.770
我也该为它而战了
and it's time I started fighting for it.

1885
03:52:37.310 --> 03:52:39.440
我们是需要帮助
Well, we could definitely use the help.

1886
03:52:39.650 --> 03:52:42.860
所以很高兴你来了
So, glad you're here.

1887
03:52:44.110 --> 03:52:46.280
我没想过会看到地球的守护者
You know, I never thought I'd see the defenders of Earth

1888
03:52:46.450 --> 03:52:48.620
会团结一致  并肩作战
united and fighting as one.

1889
03:52:49.620 --> 03:52:52.000
没有你就不会发生  布鲁斯
It wouldn't have happened without you, Bruce.

1890
03:52:53.460 --> 03:52:55.830
你父母会为你感到骄傲
Your mother and father would be proud.

1891
03:52:57.210 --> 03:52:58.380
希望如此
I hope so.

1892
03:53:04.430 --> 03:53:07.390
我会保持联系
Well, I'll be in touch.

1893
03:53:08.430 --> 03:53:12.470
对了  有些人叫我…
Oh, and some have called me

1894
03:53:12.640 --> 03:53:14.940
火星猎人
the Martian Manhunter.

1895
03:53:22.650 --> 03:53:24.990
我猜我会再见到你
I guess I'll see you around.

1896
03:53:55.430 --> 03:54:01.530
献给奥特姆
